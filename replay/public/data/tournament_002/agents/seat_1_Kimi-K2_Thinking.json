          "reasoning_content": "  We need to decide on an action for Hand #1 - Preflop. We are Seat 1 (BTN) with Ah Qc. We have 200 chips (100 BB). Blinds are 1/2. Pot is 11 chips. Actions: Seat 2 posted SB 1, Seat 3 posted BB 2, Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called 4. So we are facing a raise of 4 (which is a min-raise? Actually seat 4 raised to 4, which is a raise of 2 over the BB of 2? Wait blinds are 1/2, so SB is 1, BB is 2. Seat 4 raised to 4, which is a raise of 2 (i.e., a min-raise). Seat 5 called. So we are on the BTN, facing a raise to 4. We have Ah Qc. We need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nWe have a strong hand: AQ offsuit is a premium hand, especially on the BTN. The raise is small (to 4). The pot is 11 chips. We have 200 chips. We can call, raise, or fold. We need to consider opponent tendencies. We can use tools to recall opponent actions.\n\nWe have tools: recall_my_hands, search_opponent_actions, recall_opponent_actions. We need to search for opponent actions. We need to recall opponent actions for specific opponents. The opponents are Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Seat 2 and Seat 3 are SB and BB respectively. But we need to recall opponent actions for these opponents.\n\nWe need to decide on an action. Let's think.\n\nWe have Ah Qc. This is a strong hand. The raise is small. The BTN is a good position. We can call or raise. We can also fold, but that would be too tight. We need to consider opponent tendencies. Let's search for opponent actions.\n\nWe can use search_opponent_actions with query \"MiniMax-M2\" or \"GPT-OSS-120B\". But we need to know what they have done in past hands. However we have no memory of past hands. This is Hand #1. So there is no prior history. So we cannot recall any opponent actions. So we need to rely on default assumptions.\n\nThus we should treat this as a standard scenario: BTN vs a small raise from MP (Seat 4) and a call from CO (Seat 5). The raise is small, indicating possibly a weak hand or a trapping hand. But we have no reads. So we should treat this as a standard situation: BTN with AQ offsuit facing a small raise and a call. We should raise for value and to isolate. We can raise to something like 12-16 chips. The minimum raise to is 6 (i.e., we can raise to at least 6). But we can raise larger. We have 200 chips. We can raise to 12 or 14. Let's decide.\n\nWe need to consider the pot: currently 11 chips (SB 1, BB 2, raise 4, call 4). If we raise to 12, that is a raise of 8 over the current bet of 4. So we would be putting 12 chips. That would be a decent size. If we raise to 14, that is a raise of 10. We can also raise to 16. But we need to consider that we are out of position relative to the blinds? Actually we are on the BTN, which is the best position. So we can raise to isolate and get value from weaker hands.\n\nThus we should raise. Let's raise to 12. That is a standard 3x the raise size (the raise was 4, so 3x would be 12). Or we could raise to 14. But 12 is fine.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning: we have a premium hand AQ, we are on the BTN, we want to isolate and build pot, we have position.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 12, reasoning: \"BTN with AQ offsuit is a premium hand; facing a small raise and a call, we want to isolate and build pot; we have position.\"\n\nThus we output JSON.\n\nBut we need to ensure we follow the exact format: {\"action\": \"raise\", \"raise_to\": 12, \"reasoning\": \"...\"}.\n\nWe need to ensure we include \"raise_to\" only if raising. Yes.\n\nThus final answer.\n\nBut before final, let's double-check the rules: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". So if we raise to 12, that is the total amount we put in. That is correct.\n\nWe need to ensure we do not exceed our",

This board could hit:\n- Pocket pairs (sets with 55, 66, 22)\n- Straight draws (34, 47, 78)\n- Two pairs (65, 52, 62)\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in position (on the button) which is great. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- Me: 188 chips\n- Seat 4: 188 chips\n- Seat 5: 188 chips\n\n**Decision Point:**\nI can check or bet. Let me think about what to do:\n\n1. **Check**: This gives me a free card to try to hit my Ace or Queen. It keeps the pot small. If I miss the turn, I can evaluate based on their action.\n\n\n2. **Bet**: This is a good spot for a continuation bet. I showed strength preflop with a 3-bet, and this board is relatively dry. My opponents' checks suggest weakness, making a bet potentially profitable. A half-pot bet of around 20 chips could pressure them to fold marginal hands. \n\nI'll analyze my opponents' likely holdings. Seat 4's initial raise suggests a strong range, possibly pocket pairs 77+ or strong broadway hands. Seat 5's flat call indicates a slightly wider but still cautious range. The coordinated low board might have connected with their ranges in unexpected ways, so I'll need to be cautious about potential sets or two-pair hands.\n\nThe preflop action provides interesting dynamics. Seat 4's 2x raise and Seat 5's flat call create a multi-way pot that could conceal various hand strengths. My 3-bet to 12 represents significant aggression, which both opponents chose to call, indicating potential strength or speculative holdings.\n\nKey observations emerge: the small flop size suggests potential vulnerability, and the coordinated nature of the board might favor drawing hands. With 39 chips already in the pot and 176 chips behind, I have substantial room for strategic maneuvering.\n\nThe preflop ranges for both opponents seem weighted towards pocket pairs, broadway cards, and potential suited connectors. Their flop checks could signal uncertainty or a desire to control pot size.\n\nMy aggressive preflop image provides an opportunity to continue applying pressure. A continuation bet would represent strength, potentially folding out weaker holdings while maintaining initiative in the hand.\n\nI'm considering a 20-chip bet, which represents about half the pot. This sizing allows me to maintain control while not overcommitting if faced with resistance. The goal is to capitalize on my perceived strength and potentially take down the pot immediately.\n\nHowever, the coordinated board texture gives me pause. While I have two overcards, the potential for opponents to have connected in multiple ways suggests caution might be prudent. Checking could allow me to gather more information on the turn without risking additional chips.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on balancing aggression with pot control, weighing the benefits of a continuation bet against the risks of potentially inflating the pot with a marginal holding.\n\nMy preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and opponents likely perceive me as having premium hands. The dry flop texture actually favors my perceived range, making a continuation bet strategically sound. A half-pot bet of 20 chips could effectively leverage my table image and potentially take down the pot.\n\nI'm considering checking to manage pot size and preserve my stack. With 188 chips, I have flexibility, but I want to avoid unnecessary risks. Checking allows me to see the turn card without committing more chips, which aligns with a more conservative approach given my current hand strength.\n\nThe key is balancing aggression with prudent stack management, weighing the potential benefits of a continuation bet against the risk of overcommitting with a marginal holding.\n\nI'll analyze the board texture and opponent behaviors to make the most strategic decision, focusing on preserving my tournament life while maintaining an opportunity"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (Button) with A\u2665 Q\u2663\n- My stack: 188 chips (94 BB)\n- Board: 5\u2663 6\u2666 2\u2660 (rainbow, low cards)\n- Pot: 39 chips\n- Action: Both opponents checked to me\n\n**My Hand:**\n- A\u2665 Q\u2663 gives me two overcards to the board\n- No flush draw (hearts and clubs)\n- No straight draw\n- Essentially just two overcards\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called my 3-bet preflop, checked flop\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Called my 3-bet preflop, checked flop\n\n**Preflop Action:**\n- Seat 4 raised to 4\n- Seat 5 called\n- I 3-bet to 12 (a good sizing)\n- Both called\n\n**Flop Analysis:**\nThe flop is 5\u2663 6\u2666 2\u2660 - very coordinated in terms of low cards but not particularly dangerous for overpairs. This board could hit:\n- Pocket pairs (sets with 55, 66, 22)\n- Straight draws (34, 47, 78)\n- Two pairs (65, 52, 62)\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in position (on the button) which is great. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- Me: 188 chips\n- Seat 4: 188 chips\n- Seat 5: 188 chips\n\n**Decision Point:**\nI can check or bet. Let me think about what to do:\n\n1. **Check**: This gives me a free card to try to hit my Ace or Queen. It keeps the pot small. If I miss the turn, I can evaluate based on their action.\n\n\n2. **Bet**: This is a good spot for a continuation bet. I showed strength preflop with a 3-bet, and this board is relatively dry. My opponents' checks suggest weakness, making a bet potentially profitable. A half-pot bet of around 20 chips could pressure them to fold marginal hands. \n\nI'll analyze my opponents' likely holdings. Seat 4's initial raise suggests a strong range, possibly pocket pairs 77+ or strong broadway hands. Seat 5's flat call indicates a slightly wider but still cautious range. The coordinated low board might have connected with their ranges in unexpected ways, so I'll need to be cautious about potential sets or two-pair hands.\n\nThe preflop action provides interesting dynamics. Seat 4's 2x raise and Seat 5's flat call create a multi-way pot that could conceal various hand strengths. My 3-bet to 12 represents significant aggression, which both opponents chose to call, indicating potential strength or speculative holdings.\n\nKey observations emerge: the small flop size suggests potential vulnerability, and the coordinated nature of the board might favor drawing hands. With 39 chips already in the pot and 176 chips behind, I have substantial room for strategic maneuvering.\n\nThe preflop ranges for both opponents seem weighted towards pocket pairs, broadway cards, and potential suited connectors. Their flop checks could signal uncertainty or a desire to control pot size.\n\nMy aggressive preflop image provides an opportunity to continue applying pressure. A continuation bet would represent strength, potentially folding out weaker holdings while maintaining initiative in the hand.\n\nI'm considering a 20-chip bet, which represents about half the pot. This sizing allows me to maintain control while not overcommitting if faced with resistance. The goal is to capitalize on my perceived strength and potentially take down the pot immediately.\n\nHowever, the coordinated board texture gives me pause. While I have two overcards, the potential for opponents to have connected in multiple ways suggests caution might be prudent. Checking could allow me to gather more information on the turn without risking additional chips.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on balancing aggression with pot control, weighing the benefits of a continuation bet against the risks of potentially inflating the pot with a marginal holding.\n\nMy preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and opponents likely perceive me as having premium hands. The dry flop texture actually favors my perceived range, making a continuation bet strategically sound. A half-pot bet of 20 chips could effectively leverage my table image and potentially take down the pot.\n\nI'm considering checking to manage pot size and preserve my stack. With 188 chips, I have flexibility, but I want to avoid unnecessary risks. Checking allows me to see the turn card without committing more chips, which aligns with a more conservative approach given my current hand strength.\n\nThe key is balancing aggression with prudent stack management, weighing the potential benefits of a continuation bet against the risk of overcommitting with a marginal holding.\n\nI'll analyze the board texture and opponent behaviors to make the most strategic decision, focusing on preserving my tournament life while maintaining an opportunity",

Just Ace high\n- However, this is a very coordinated board with straight possibilities (3-4, 3-7, 4-8, etc.)\n- There's also a potential flush draw with three clubs on board (5c, 2s, 7d - wait, only 5c is a club, 2s is spade, 7d is diamond. Let me recount: 5c, 6d, 2s, 7d - actually only one club. So no flush draw yet.\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called, I 3-bet to 12, both called\n- Flop: I bet 20, both called\n- Turn: Seat 4 leads out for 20, Seat 5 folds\n\nThis is interesting. Seat 4 called my 3-bet preflop, called my flop bet, and now is leading the turn. Seat 5 was in between but folded.\n\nLet me think about what Seat 4 might have:\n- They raised preflop from early position (seat 4 is MP)\n- Called a 3-bet\n- Called a flop bet\n- Now betting the turn\n\nThe board is 5-6-2-7. This hits a lot of hands that would raise preflop:\n- Pairs: 77, 66, 55, 22 would all be strong\n- Straight draws: 34, 48, 89 for open-ended\n- Overpairs: 88-TT might play this way\n- Two pairs: 75, 76, 65, etc.\n\n\n- I need to consider my tournament position carefully\n- My chip stack is relatively healthy at 84 BB\n- The pot is getting substantial at 119 chips\n- Calling risks 20 chips, which is about 12% of my stack\n- The potential loss could impact my tournament standing\n\nI'm realizing my initial flush draw assessment was incorrect. The board actually shows limited flush potential. This means my Ace-high hand is even weaker than I first thought. The turn bet from Seat 4 suggests they have a made hand or strong draw. With my current holding, folding seems the most prudent move to protect my chip stack and tournament position. I need to consider the betting patterns and potential opponent strategies. The small turn bet suggests either a defensive move with a vulnerable hand or a strategic probe bet. My preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and my flop bet indicates confidence. \n\nOpponents' actions reveal interesting dynamics: Seat 4's consistent calls and turn bet hint at a moderately strong hand, while Seat 5's fold suggests weakness. The pot odds of nearly 7:1 make calling tempting, but the risk of facing a larger river bet is significant.\n\nI'm analyzing potential hand ranges, recognizing that many would have shown more aggression earlier if they were truly premium hands. The turn bet sizing feels like a potential blocker or defensive maneuver, trying to control the pot's progression.\n\nMy stack size of 168 chips provides some flexibility, but I must weigh the potential river scenarios carefully. The strategic implications of calling versus folding require precise calculation of potential outcomes and opponent tendencies.\n\nThe pot odds of nearly 7:1 initially seem attractive, but the underlying strategic complexity suggests a more nuanced decision is necessary. I'm sensing this might be a subtle trap, where the immediate pot odds could mask longer-term strategic disadvantages.\n\nA 20-chip call represents a calculated risk - small enough to preserve my stack, yet potentially revealing critical information about my opponent's hand strength. However, the risk of escalating commitment on the river looms large, potentially transforming a small call into a more significant loss.\n\nThe key consideration is whether this turn call provides enough strategic value to justify the potential downstream risks. My tournament position and overall chip preservation strategy must take precedence over short-term pot odds.\n\nWith no strong draw and only Ace-high, I'm inclined to make a disciplined fold. This decision protects my 148-chip stack and avoids getting drawn into a potentially expensive confrontation where I'm likely behind.\n\nThe hand's history suggests some strength from Seat 4, and my current holding doesn't justify continued investment. Preserving chips for more favorable situations seems the wisest approach.\n\nI'll use the search tool to review my previous plays and confirm"

The board actually shows limited flush potential. This means my Ace-high hand is even weaker than I first thought. The turn bet from Seat 4 suggests they have a made hand or strong draw. With my current holding, folding seems the most prudent move to protect my chip stack and tournament position. I need to consider the betting patterns and potential opponent strategies. The small turn bet suggests either a defensive move with a vulnerable hand or a strategic probe bet. My preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and my flop bet indicates confidence. \n\nOpponents' actions reveal interesting dynamics: Seat 4's consistent calls and turn bet hint at a moderately strong hand, while Seat 5's fold suggests weakness. The pot odds of nearly 7:1 make calling tempting, but the risk of facing a larger river bet is significant.\n\nI'm analyzing potential hand ranges, recognizing that many would have shown more aggression earlier if they were truly premium hands. The turn bet sizing feels like a potential blocker or defensive maneuver, trying to control the pot's progression.\n\nMy stack size of 168 chips provides some flexibility, but I must weigh the potential river scenarios carefully. The strategic implications of calling versus folding require precise calculation of potential outcomes and opponent tendencies.\n\nThe pot odds of nearly 7:1 initially seem attractive, but the underlying strategic complexity suggests a more nuanced decision is necessary. I'm sensing this might be a subtle trap, where the immediate pot odds could mask longer-term strategic disadvantages.\n\nA 20-chip call represents a calculated risk - small enough to preserve my stack, yet potentially revealing critical information about my opponent's hand strength. However, the risk of escalating commitment on the river looms large, potentially transforming a small call into a more significant loss.\n\nThe key consideration is whether this turn call provides enough strategic value to justify the potential downstream risks. My tournament position and overall chip preservation strategy must take precedence over short-term pot odds.\n\nWith no strong draw and only Ace-high, I'm inclined to make a disciplined fold. This decision protects my 148-chip stack and avoids getting drawn into a potentially expensive confrontation where I'm likely behind.\n\nThe hand's history suggests some strength from Seat 4, and my current holding doesn't justify continued investment. Preserving chips for more favorable situations seems the wisest approach.\n\nI'll use the search tool to review my previous plays and confirm",

It's suited but the cards are disconnected (gap). This is not a strong hand from early position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I will be out of position post-flop against everyone.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the hand history I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Raised to 4 (2x BB) in Hand #1, then called a 3-bet to 12. Seems somewhat loose/passive.\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Folded in Hand #1 after a raise.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Folded in Hand #1.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Called a raise in Hand #1.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have 84 BB, which is a comfortable stack.\n   - From UTG, I should be playing tight.\n   - The pot is small (3 chips), and I need to call 2 chips.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not great for a speculative hand.\n\n6. **Stack Preservation**: From UTG with a marginal hand, folding is the standard play. Calling or raising would be loose.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold from UTG with J6s. It's too weak to play from early position, especially out of position post-flop. I don't have enough information to justify playing this hand speculatively.\n\nLet me check if there are any other observations I should make:\n- The hand history shows opponents are playing somewhat standard.\n- No one has shown extreme aggression or passivity patterns yet.\n- From UTG, I should be playing very tight.\n\nI should fold this hand.",

It's not a hand I want to play in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 166 chips (83 BB) - This is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - Small blind (Seat 5) posted 1 chip\n   - I posted big blind of 2 chips\n   - Everyone folded to the small blind\n   - Small blind called the additional 1 chip (limped in)\n\n5. **Pot**: Currently 4 chips\n6. **To call**: 0 (I can check)\n7. **Legal actions**: fold, check, raise\n\n8. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Hand 1: Called preflop, called a raise, called flop bet, folded on turn\n   - Hand 2: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 3: Checked through entire hand, folded on river\n   - This suggests a somewhat passive player who doesn't fold to aggression easily but also doesn't show much aggression themselves\n\n**Decision factors**:\n- My hand is very weak (85o) - one of the worst hands in poker\n- I'm out of position postflop (small blind will act first)\n- The small blind just limped, which often indicates a weak/marginal hand\n- I could check and see a free flop, but even if I hit something, it's unlikely to be strong\n- Raising would be a bluff/steal attempt, but with 85o I have very little equity if called\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips), so there's not much to win\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a decent stack (83 BB), so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- Stealing the 4-chip pot isn't worth the risk with such a weak hand\n- Better to preserve my chips for better spots\n\nThe best play here is to **check** and see a free flop, or possibly fold. Since checking is free and I have position postflop, checking makes more sense than folding. If I hit something strong (like two pair or better), I could potentially win a bigger pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 85o, even checking might be questionable. But since it's free to check and I'm in position, I'll check and see if I can hit something. The risk is minimal.",

I have nothing to gain by betting here. My hand is complete trash with no equity. Even against a passive opponent, there's no value in betting as a bluff because:\n1. The pot is tiny (4 chips)\n2. My opponent has shown they can fold when facing aggression\n3. I have zero equity if called\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 8s 5h - Very weak hand, no pair, no draw, just 8-high\n\n**Board:** 4h Td 2s Kd 4d\n- Final board shows: 4-4-T-K-d (two diamonds)\n- Possible hands:\n  - Any pair beats me\n  - Two pairs, sets, straights, flushes all beat me\n  - I have absolutely nothing - just 8-high\n\n**Situation:**\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Villain (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) bet 2 on the river\n- I need to call 2 to win 8 (6+2) = 4:1 pot odds\n- I have 166 chips, so calling costs me very little relative to my stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- Hand 1: Called preflop, called flop bet of 20, folded on turn\n- Hand 2: Folded preflop  \n- Hand 3: Checked through entire hand, folded on river\n- Hand 4 (current): Posted SB, called preflop, checked flop/turn, now betting river\n\nPattern: This opponent seems passive/trappy. They've shown willingness to call bets but also check often. The river bet here is unusual for them based on the limited history - this is their first river bet shown.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have 8-high, which is essentially the worst possible hand here. I cannot beat ANY pair, any two pair, any set, any straight, any flush. The only hands I beat are complete bluffs with 7-high or worse.\n\n2. **Board texture:** The board has paired (4s), has a King, and a possible flush draw came in on the river (4d). This is a scary board that could hit many hands.\n\n3. **Opponent's line:** They checked flop and turn, then bet small on river (2 into 6 pot = 1/3 pot). This could be:\n   - A value bet with a made hand (pair, two pair, trips, etc.)\n   - A bluff trying to steal the pot\n   - A thin value bet with a weak hand\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 2 to win 8, getting 4:1 odds. This means I need to win at least 20% of the time to break even.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack (83 BB). Losing 2 chips won't hurt me, but it's still burning chips with a very weak hand.\n\n**Decision:** I have 8-high with no draw, no pair. Even though the pot odds are decent (4:1), I need to win 20% of the time. Given that my opponent checked twice and now bets river, they're representing some strength. With 8-high, I lose to:\n- Any pair (and there are many pairs possible)\n- Any King\n- Any flush\n- Any two pair/trips\n\nThe only way I win is if they're bluffing with complete air. While possible, it's not likely enough to justify calling with 8-high. This is a clear fold.\n\nI should not raise as a bluff because:\n1. I have no equity if called\n2. The opponent has shown they'll call bets (called 20 chip bet in hand 1)\n3. My stack is healthy, no need to make desperate moves\n4. The board is scary and could easily have hit their range",

It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but the kicker (Ten) is not great when paired with the Ace.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position at the table, I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 165 chips (82.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 7 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (min-raise from 2)\n- Amount to call: 3 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 6 chips\n\nLet me look at MiniMax-M2's preflop tendencies:\n- Hand 1: raised to 4, then called 8\n- Hand 2: checked (no preflop action recorded, so this might be a call or check in BB)\n- Hand 3: folded\n- Hand 4: folded\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be playing somewhat tight, raising in Hand 1 and folding in Hands 3 and 4. The raise in this hand (Hand 5) is only a min-raise to 4.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 3 to win 7, which is about 30% pot odds.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: AcTs is a decent speculative hand. It has good playability postflop, especially in position.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 seems relatively tight but is only making a min-raise here.\n4. **Stack sizes**: Both players have deep stacks (82+ BB), so implied odds are good if I hit a strong hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Calling 3 chips (1.5 BB) with a speculative hand in position seems like a good investment.\n\nI could also consider a 3-bet to 6 chips. However, given that:\n- MiniMax-M2 seems somewhat tight\n- I have position\n- Aces with weak kickers can be problematic if I hit an Ace\n- I want to keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n\nI think calling is the best option. It allows me to see the flop cheaply, in position, with a hand that can flop well. If I miss completely, I can easily fold. If I hit a strong hand (Ace with good kicker, two pair, flush draw, straight draw), I can play aggressively.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Ac Ts - I have top pair with a decent kicker (Ace kicker). The board is 5s 2d Th.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - best position\n**Stack:** 162 chips (81 BB) - healthy stack\n**Pot:** 10 chips\n**Board:** 5s 2d Th - Rainbow board with no flush draws. Only straight draw possibility is 3-4, but that's unlikely.\n\n**Current situation:** It's just me vs. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who made a small preflop raise to 4 chips (2x BB). I called from the button.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, called a re-raise, checked flop, called 20 on flop, bet 20 on turn\n- Hand 2: Checked preflop (was in BB), checked flop, bet 2 on turn, folded river\n- Hand 3 & 4: Folded preflop\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat active but not overly aggressive. They seem to make small bets and calls. They folded in later hands, suggesting they might be playing tighter now.\n\n**Hand strength:** I have top pair with a good kicker. This is a strong hand on this dry board. There are no flush draws, and only gutshot straight possibilities (34). I'm likely ahead of most of MiniMax-M2's range unless they have:\n- A better Ten (unlikely, I have Ace kicker)\n- An overpair (22, 55 - but 55 would have made a set)\n- 55 or 22 for a set (possible but unlikely)\n- A complete bluff\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 10 chips. I have the option to check or bet.\n\n**Decision:** I should bet for value here. This is a strong hand on a dry board, and I want to extract value from worse hands. A small to medium-sized bet would be appropriate - maybe 5-7 chips (50-70% pot). This allows worse hands to call while building the pot.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 2 chips (which seems like a system quirk - it should be at least 2 chips to bet), I can bet any amount from 2 up to my stack. I'll make a value bet of about 6 chips (60% pot).\n\nLet me make a bet of 6 chips.",

My hand is strong but vulnerable to:\n- Flush draws (two spades on board)\n- Straight draws (3-4-5-6-7, though unlikely)\n- Better Tens (KT, QT, JT, T9)\n\nHowever, MiniMax called my flop bet, which suggests they have something. They could have:\n\n\n- A weaker Ten (T9, T8, T7)\n- A pocket pair (99, 88, 66)\n- A flush draw\n- A straight draw\n\nI'll carefully consider the betting strategy. A value bet of around 12-16 chips seems appropriate - large enough to charge draws but not so big that I scare away weaker hands. This sizing allows me to extract value while protecting against potential draws. The goal is to maximize my winnings with this strong but not unbeatable hand.\n\nGiven the pot size of 22 chips and my remaining stack of 150 chips, a 16-chip bet feels like the right balance. It represents about 73% of the pot, which should be compelling enough to get called by weaker hands while still providing decent protection.",

They raised preflop to 4, then just called my flop bet (6) and turn bet (16). This suggests they have something but not a monster hand.\n\n**Pot odds and sizing:**\n- Pot is 54 chips\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 16 (which is the size of my turn bet)\n- My stack is 140 chips, so I have plenty behind\n\n**What could MiniMax-M2 have?**\nGiven the board and their actions:\n- They could have a Q (top pair)\n- They could have a T (same as me)\n- They could have a pocket pair like 88, 99, JJ\n- They could have a flush draw that missed (but only 2 spades on board, so unlikely)\n- They could have a straight draw that missed\n\nSince they just called the turn, they likely don't have a monster like a set or two pair that would have the Q. They might be scared of the Q.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have top pair with a good kicker. Given that MiniMax-M2 has just been calling, I think I have the best hand most of the time. I should value bet here. \n\nThe minimum raise is 16, which would be a reasonable value bet - about 30% of pot. I could bet more, but 16 seems reasonable to get called by worse hands like Tx, 9x, or pocket pairs.\n\nLet me check what bet sizing makes sense. Pot is 54, so a 16 bet is about 30% pot - that's a good value bet size that worse hands might call.\n\nI should bet for value here.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 8h 3c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, but preflop it doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**To call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Very tight, has folded 5 out of 7 preflop actions. Only called once and folded on turn. Seems very conservative.\n- Seat 3 (BB): More active, has called preflop with some regularity and makes bets on later streets. Seems to defend their blind.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 8-3 offsuit is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n2. **Position**: While button is good, it doesn't compensate for such a weak hand.\n3. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 odds. This is terrible for a hand with such low probability of winning.\n4. **Implied odds**: Very low. Even if we hit something like a pair of 8s, we'll often be dominated.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament with healthy stack. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds often. But Seat 3 (BB) defends their blind regularly, so a steal attempt would be risky.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the pot odds are bad, and one opponent defends their blind. No reason to invest chips here.",

The Ten is a decent high card, but the Four is very low.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I act first post-flop, so I have no information about other players' actions.\n\n3. **My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - I have a healthy stack, slightly above average.\n\n4. **Action before me**: \n   - SB posted 1 chip\n   - BB posted 2 chips\n   - Seat 5 folded\n   - I need to call 2 chips to see the flop\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 3 chips, I need to call 2 chips to make it 5 chips total. That's 2:2.5 or about 44% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand evaluation**: \n   - Ts4s is a suited hand, so it has some flush potential\n   - However, it's a very weak hand UTG\n   - The \"gap\" between the cards is large (6 ranks apart)\n   - Even if I hit a flush, it could be dominated by higher spade hands\n   - My stack is healthy, so I don't need to take marginal spots\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- Early in a tournament (or at this stack depth), I should be playing tight from early position\n- UTG requires premium hands or at least strong speculative hands\n- Ts4s doesn't qualify as a strong speculative hand due to the low card\n\n**Opponent information**: I don't have any specific reads on these opponents yet since this is only hand #7. Let me check if I can recall any observations about their play patterns.\n\nActually, let me think about whether I should use the recall tools. This is hand #7, so I might have some limited information. Let me check if there are any patterns I should be aware of.\n\nGiven that this is only hand #7, I probably don't have much reliable data yet. The sample size is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about opponent tendencies.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Ts4s is too weak to play from UTG position, even with the suitedness. \n\n- I have no position advantage\n- The hand has poor equity realization\n- I risk getting into trouble post-flop\n- My stack is healthy enough that I don't need to take marginal spots\n- The implied odds aren't great because if I hit a flush, I might not get paid off by better hands, and I could lose a big pot to a higher flush\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

MiniMax-M2 is not overly aggressive preflop\n2. They tend to see flops with marginal hands but are capable of folding\n3. Their preflop raise in hand 5 was to 4 (a min-raise relative to blinds)\n4. Most of their aggression comes post-flop, not preflop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 5h Jd is a very weak hand, offsuit and disconnected\n- Even against a loose opponent, this is a fold-worthy hand\n- However, I have the option to check for free\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- This is a free check situation (no additional chips to see flop)\n- While my hand is weak, checking costs nothing\n- The pot is small (5 chips)\n- MiniMax-M2's range is likely weak given their tendency to fold often\n\n**Tournament Context:**\n- I'm at 96 BB, healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- But checking is risk-free\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nThe hand is weak but checking is completely free. I should check and see the flop. There's no downside to checking, and while 5h Jd is weak, any hand can hit a lucky flop. The opponent's range is also likely weak based on their folding frequency.\n\nI should NOT raise because:\n- My hand is too weak\n- Raising would commit chips with a terrible hand\n- MiniMax-M2 might call or re-raise, putting me in a tough spot\n\nI should NOT fold because:\n- Checking is free\n- No risk involved\n- Could potentially hit a miracle flop (though unlikely)\n\n**Final Decision:** Check",

My hand strength and potential:**\n- I have J5 offsuit (5h Jd)\n- The flop is Js 8d 9c\n- I have top pair with a weak kicker (J5)\n- There are straight draws possible (T-7 makes a straight, Q-T makes a straight)\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (I need a 7 to make a straight)\n\n**2. Position and stack size:**\n- I'm in BB position (out of position)\n- My stack: 192 chips (96 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 is in Seat 4, called preflop from MP position\n\n**3. Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They call preflop frequently (hands 1, 2, 8)\n- They check/call flops often (hands 1, 2, 5)\n- They make small bets on later streets (bets of 2, 4, 6, 20 chips)\n- They fold on rivers sometimes (hands 2, 5)\n- They seem to play a passive, calling style with occasional small bets\n\n**4. Board texture:**\n- Js 8d 9c - Coordinated board with straight draws\n- I have top pair but weak kicker\n- Possible straight draws: T-7, Q-T\n- Possible flush draws: No flush draw yet (one diamond)\n- This is a somewhat dangerous board\n\n**5. Action analysis:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax called 2 chips (limp)\n- I checked in BB\n- On flop, it's checked to me (0 to call)\n- I can check or bet\n\n**Decision:**\nWith top pair weak kicker on a coordinated board, out of position against a passive opponent who likes to call, I should:\n- Bet for value/protection\n- A small to medium bet can get value from weaker Jx hands, 8x, 9x, or draws\n- If I check, I give free cards to draws and lose initiative\n\nGiven the pot is 5 chips, a bet of 3-4 chips (60-80% pot) seems appropriate. This is enough to charge draws but not too big to only get called by better hands.\n\nLet me bet 4 chips (80% pot) to protect my hand and get value.",

Let me think about this hand.\n\nFirst, my hand: 5h Jd. I have a pair of Jacks on the board. The board is Js 8d 9c 4h.\n\nSo I have top pair (Jacks) with a 5 kicker. The board is somewhat coordinated:\n- There are straight possibilities: 7-T, 8-Q, etc.\n- There are flush possibilities: The board has 8d, 9c, 4h - so no flush possible yet, but there are diamonds and hearts and clubs.\n\nLet me think about the action:\n- Preflop: I posted BB, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 2, others folded. I checked my option.\n- Flop: I bet 4 into a pot of ~5 (1+2+2). So I bet ~80% pot. MiniMax called.\n- Turn: The 4h came. Now the board is Js 8d 9c 4h.\n\nThe pot is currently 13 chips (2+2+4+4+1?). Let me recalculate:\n- Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, call 2 = 5 chips\n- Flop: I bet 4, he called 4 = +8, so pot is 13 chips. Yes.\n\nNow it's on me on the turn. I can check or raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total (which would be a min-raise, but that doesn't make sense - wait, the minimum raise TO is 4, meaning I can raise to 4 total, which would be checking? No, that must be a mistake. Usually minimum raise TO would be at least the size of the previous bet. Let me re-read: \"Minimum raise to: 4\". That seems odd. Usually if the last bet was 4, the minimum raise would be to 8 total (another 4). But maybe the system means \"minimum additional amount\" is 4? No, it says \"Minimum raise to: 4\". And \"Amount to call: 0\". So I can check for free, or raise to at least 4 total. That would be a min-bet of 4 chips.\n\nSo my options are:\n- Check\n- Bet (raise to) 4 chips or more\n- Fold (but why would I fold when I can check for free?)\n\nLet me think about my hand strength:\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker (5)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with straight possibilities\n- The turn card (4h) doesn't change much, but it could complete a straight if someone has 5-7 or could make a set if someone has 44\n- The flush draw is not present on the board\n\nI need to consider my opponent's tendencies. Let me look at what I found about MiniMax-M2:\n\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions:\n- Hand 1: Preflop call 8, flop check, flop call 20, turn bet 20\n- Hand 2: Preflop check, flop check, turn bet 2, river fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n- Hand 5: Preflop raise 4, flop call 6, turn call 16, river fold\n- Hand 6: Preflop fold\n- Hand 7"

Let me think about this hand.\n\nFirst, my hand: 5h Jd. I have a pair of Jacks on the board. The board is Js 8d 9c 4h.\n\nSo I have top pair (Jacks) with a 5 kicker. The board is somewhat coordinated:\n- There are straight possibilities: 7-T, 8-Q, etc.\n- There are flush possibilities: The board has 8d, 9c, 4h - so no flush possible yet, but there are diamonds and hearts and clubs.\n\nLet me think about the action:\n- Preflop: I posted BB, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 2, others folded. I checked my option.\n- Flop: I bet 4 into a pot of ~5 (1+2+2). So I bet ~80% pot. MiniMax called.\n- Turn: The 4h came. Now the board is Js 8d 9c 4h.\n\nThe pot is currently 13 chips (2+2+4+4+1?). Let me recalculate:\n- Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, call 2 = 5 chips\n- Flop: I bet 4, he called 4 = +8, so pot is 13 chips. Yes.\n\nNow it's on me on the turn. I can check or raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total (which would be a min-raise, but that doesn't make sense - wait, the minimum raise TO is 4, meaning I can raise to 4 total, which would be checking? No, that must be a mistake. Usually minimum raise TO would be at least the size of the previous bet. Let me re-read: \"Minimum raise to: 4\". That seems odd. Usually if the last bet was 4, the minimum raise would be to 8 total (another 4). But maybe the system means \"minimum additional amount\" is 4? No, it says \"Minimum raise to: 4\". And \"Amount to call: 0\". So I can check for free, or raise to at least 4 total. That would be a min-bet of 4 chips.\n\nSo my options are:\n- Check\n- Bet (raise to) 4 chips or more\n- Fold (but why would I fold when I can check for free?)\n\nLet me think about my hand strength:\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker (5)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with straight possibilities\n- The turn card (4h) doesn't change much, but it could complete a straight if someone has 5-7 or could make a set if someone has 44\n- The flush draw is not present on the board\n\nI need to consider my opponent's tendencies. Let me look at what I found about MiniMax-M2:\n\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions:\n- Hand 1: Preflop call 8, flop check, flop call 20, turn bet 20\n- Hand 2: Preflop check, flop check, turn bet 2, river fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n- Hand 5: Preflop raise 4, flop call 6, turn call 16, river fold\n- Hand 6: Preflop fold\n- Hand 7",

          "reasoning_content": "  I need to provide a JSON response with my action. Let me think through this hand carefully.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have Jd5h and the board is Js 8d 9c 4h\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker\n- The pot is 13 chips\n- I bet 4 on the flop and got called by MiniMax-M2\n- It's now the turn and it's checked to me (amount to call is 0)\n- I can check or bet (minimum bet is 4 chips)\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: Top pair, weak kicker. The board is somewhat coordinated (straight draws possible)\n2. Position: I'm out of position (BB) \n3. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 called my flop bet. From the hand history, they seem to call bets but also fold to pressure sometimes\n4. Pot odds: If I bet, I need to think about what hands would call\n5. Tournament: We're still relatively deep stacked (94 BB)\n\nLet me think about what MiniMax-M2 could have:\n- They called preflop from a non-BB position\n- They called a flop bet on Js 8d 9c\n- Possible hands: Jx (better kicker), 89, 9T, 78, TT, 99, 88, draws\n\nThe turn card is 4h which is largely a blank. It doesn't complete any obvious draws.\n\nShould I bet or check?\n- If I bet, I'm value betting my top pair but also potentially facing a raise from better hands\n- If I check, I give a free card but I also control the pot size with my marginal hand\n\nGiven that I have top pair but a weak kicker, and the board is coordinated, I think checking is the better play. This is a pot control decision. I don't want to build a big pot with a marginal hand, and checking might induce a bluff from worse hands or allow me to see a cheap showdown.\n\nIf I bet:\n- Better hands will call/raise\n- Worse hands might fold\n- I'm not getting value from much worse\n\nIf I check:\n- I induce bluffs\n- I keep the pot small\n- I can call a reasonable river bet\n\nI think checking is the best option here.",

This gives me:\n- One pair of Jacks (top pair)\n- Kicker: 5h (very weak kicker)\n- No flush draw\n- No straight draw currently\n\n**Board Texture:**\nThis is a somewhat dangerous board. There are:\n- Possible straight draws (7-T, 6-7, T-Q)\n- The 8d-9c could create straight possibilities\n- The turn 4h doesn't change much but could complete some draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nLet me look at their betting patterns from the recall data:\n\n1. **Hand 1**: Called preflop, checked flop, called 20 on flop, bet 20 on turn\n2. **Hand 2**: Checked preflop, checked flop, bet 2 on turn, folded river\n3. **Hand 5**: Raised preflop to 4, called 6 on flop, called 16 on turn, folded river\n4. **Hand 8**: Called preflop, bet 4 on flop, checked turn, bet 6 on river\n\nKey observations:\n- They bet small amounts frequently (2, 4, 6, 20)\n- In Hand 1, they bet 20 on turn after calling a big flop bet - suggests strength\n- In Hand 5, they raised preflop, called flop and turn, then folded river - suggests they can continue with marginal hands\n- In Hand 8, they bet flop, checked turn, then bet river - could be probing bets\n\n**Current Hand Dynamics:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped in)\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called 4 (they called my small flop bet)\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4 (small probe bet)\n\nThis betting pattern suggests they could have:\n1. A marginal hand testing if I have something\n2. A draw that they're semi-bluffing\n3. A weak made hand trying to get value\n4. Air trying to steal the pot\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 17\n- Bet: 4\n- Pot odds: 21:4 or 5.25:1\n- I need roughly 16% equity to call profitably\n\n**My Equity:**\nWith just a pair of Jacks with a terrible kicker, my hand is vulnerable. However, given the small bet size and the pot odds, folding seems too weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too weak given pot odds and opponent's small bet size\n2. **Call**: Reasonable - see the river, pot odds are good\n3. **Raise**: Could be an option - I have top pair and the opponent is betting small. A raise could get them to fold better Jacks (like J-T, J-9) or draws.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- I have a weak kicker - if they have a better Jack, I'm behind\n- The board has straight possibilities\n- Their bet is very small (4 into 17), suggesting weakness or a probe\n- I have position (I'm BB, they're in later position)\n- My stack is healthy, so I can afford to play\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWhile this is a cash game format (based on chip stacks), I should still be somewhat protective of my stack, but I'm not in danger.\n\n**Opponent's Turn Bet Pattern:**\nLooking at the recall data, they bet 2 on turn in Hand 2, bet 20 on turn in Hand 1, called 16 on turn in Hand 5. They seem to bet small frequently. This 4-chip bet seems like a weak bet or a probe.\n\n**My Action:**\nI think raising is the best play here. Here's why:\n1. I have top pair and can represent strength\n2. Their small bet suggests weakness\n3. I can get value from draws and weaker pairs\n4. If they have a better Jack, they might just call or fold to a raise\n5. Getting them to fold now would be fine too\n\nIf I raise, the minimum is to 8 (double their bet). I could raise to something like 12-16.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. I have a very weak kicker. If they have J-T, J-9, J-8,"

This gives me:\n- One pair of Jacks (top pair)\n- Kicker: 5h (very weak kicker)\n- No flush draw\n- No straight draw currently\n\n**Board Texture:**\nThis is a somewhat dangerous board. There are:\n- Possible straight draws (7-T, 6-7, T-Q)\n- The 8d-9c could create straight possibilities\n- The turn 4h doesn't change much but could complete some draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nLet me look at their betting patterns from the recall data:\n\n1. **Hand 1**: Called preflop, checked flop, called 20 on flop, bet 20 on turn\n2. **Hand 2**: Checked preflop, checked flop, bet 2 on turn, folded river\n3. **Hand 5**: Raised preflop to 4, called 6 on flop, called 16 on turn, folded river\n4. **Hand 8**: Called preflop, bet 4 on flop, checked turn, bet 6 on river\n\nKey observations:\n- They bet small amounts frequently (2, 4, 6, 20)\n- In Hand 1, they bet 20 on turn after calling a big flop bet - suggests strength\n- In Hand 5, they raised preflop, called flop and turn, then folded river - suggests they can continue with marginal hands\n- In Hand 8, they bet flop, checked turn, then bet river - could be probing bets\n\n**Current Hand Dynamics:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped in)\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called 4 (they called my small flop bet)\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4 (small probe bet)\n\nThis betting pattern suggests they could have:\n1. A marginal hand testing if I have something\n2. A draw that they're semi-bluffing\n3. A weak made hand trying to get value\n4. Air trying to steal the pot\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 17\n- Bet: 4\n- Pot odds: 21:4 or 5.25:1\n- I need roughly 16% equity to call profitably\n\n**My Equity:**\nWith just a pair of Jacks with a terrible kicker, my hand is vulnerable. However, given the small bet size and the pot odds, folding seems too weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too weak given pot odds and opponent's small bet size\n2. **Call**: Reasonable - see the river, pot odds are good\n3. **Raise**: Could be an option - I have top pair and the opponent is betting small. A raise could get them to fold better Jacks (like J-T, J-9) or draws.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- I have a weak kicker - if they have a better Jack, I'm behind\n- The board has straight possibilities\n- Their bet is very small (4 into 17), suggesting weakness or a probe\n- I have position (I'm BB, they're in later position)\n- My stack is healthy, so I can afford to play\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWhile this is a cash game format (based on chip stacks), I should still be somewhat protective of my stack, but I'm not in danger.\n\n**Opponent's Turn Bet Pattern:**\nLooking at the recall data, they bet 2 on turn in Hand 2, bet 20 on turn in Hand 1, called 16 on turn in Hand 5. They seem to bet small frequently. This 4-chip bet seems like a weak bet or a probe.\n\n**My Action:**\nI think raising is the best play here. Here's why:\n1. I have top pair and can represent strength\n2. Their small bet suggests weakness\n3. I can get value from draws and weaker pairs\n4. If they have a better Jack, they might just call or fold to a raise\n5. Getting them to fold now would be fine too\n\nIf I raise, the minimum is to 8 (double their bet). I could raise to something like 12-16.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. I have a very weak kicker. If they have J-T, J-9, J-8,",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me reconsider this hand carefully.\n\n**Current Hand Details:**\n- My hand: 5h Jd (pair of Jacks with 5 kicker)\n- Board: Js 8d 9c 4h\n- Pot: 17 chips\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 4 on the turn\n- I need to call 4 to see river\n- Pot odds: 21:4 or 5.25:1\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have top pair (Jacks) but with a terrible kicker (5). The board is somewhat coordinated with straight draws possible (7-T, 6-7, T-Q). There's also a potential flush draw on the flop (8d 9c) but the turn was 4h.\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped)\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called 4\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4\n\nThis betting pattern is interesting. They called my flop bet, which could mean:\n- They have a piece of the flop (pair, draw)\n- They have a marginal hand\n- They have a monster and are slowplaying\n\nWhen I checked the turn, they bet small (4 into 17 pot). This small bet could be:\n- A value bet with a medium strength hand\n- A probe bet with air or a weak hand\n- A blocking bet with a draw\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They bet small amounts frequently (2, 4, 6, 20)\n- They call bets fairly often\n- In Hand 1, they bet 20 on turn after calling a big flop bet (strength)\n- In Hand 5, they raised preflop, called flop and turn, then folded river (can continue with marginal hands)\n- In Hand 8, they bet flop, checked turn, bet river (probing behavior)\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n\n1. **Fold**: Too weak. I'm getting 5.25:1 pot odds and I have top pair. Folding here would be extremely tight.\n\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I can see the river for cheap. However, I'm out of position and will have to face another decision on the river. My hand is vulnerable to many turn and river cards. Also, if they have a better Jack, I'm just throwing away 4 chips.\n\n3. **Raise**: \n   - Pros: I can protect my hand against draws, get value from weaker hands, and potentially take down the pot now. Given their small bet size, a raise could get them to fold better Jacks or marginal hands.\n   - Cons: If they have a better hand (better Jack, two pair, set), I'm building a bigger pot with a dominated hand.\n\n**Key Consideration**: My kicker is terrible. If they have J-T, J-9, J-8, or even J-7, I'm crushed. The board has many cards that could beat me on the river.\n\n**Tournament/Cash Game Context**: I'm deep-stacked (188 chips, 94 BB), so I can afford to play. However, I shouldn't throw away chips unnecessarily.\n\n**Final Decision**: I think the best play is to **call**. Here's why:\n- The pot odds are excellent (5.25:1)\n- Their small bet doesn't necessarily mean strength\n- I have top pair which is often good in this spot\n- I can evaluate the river and make a better decision with more information\n- Raising could isolate me against better hands and build a pot with a marginal holding\n- Folding is too tight given the pot odds\n\nIf the river is a blank (not a T, Q, 7, 6, or card that completes obvious draws), I can consider calling a small bet or checking down. If the river is scary (completes straight, brings flush), I can fold to aggression.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider again. I have position here (I'm BB, they're in MP). When I check the turn and they bet small, this is often a weak hand or a draw. With top pair, I could raise to protect my hand and charge draws. A raise to 12-16 would be appropriate.\n\nBut my kicker is so weak... If I'm raised back, I'm in a terrible spot. If I just call, I keep the pot small and can control the river action.\n\nI think calling is the safest and most profitable play here. Good pot odds, manageable pot size, and I have a made hand.\n\nLet me make the JSON response.",

The board shows:\n- Js 8d 9c 4h 5c\n\nSo my final hand is: J J 5 5 9 (two pair with Jack kicker)\n\n**Pot:** 21 chips\n**My stack:** 184 chips\n**To call:** 0 (I can check)\n**Position:** BB vs Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)\n\nLet me analyze the action:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from CO, I checked my option\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4, I called\n\nSo we've both shown interest in this pot. The turn bet from them was small (4 into a pot of ~12-13).\n\nNow on the river, I can check or raise. Let me think about what hands MiniMax-M2 might have:\n\nFrom their history, I can see they:\n- Often call and check, sometimes make small bets\n- Have folded on river in hands 2 and 5 after betting on turn\n- Made a river bet in hand 8 for 6 chips\n\nThe board texture:\n- Js 8d 9c 4h 5c - There are straight possibilities (7-6, Q-10, J-7)\n- Flush draws missed (no flush possible)\n- I have two pair\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent two pair hand\n2. The opponent has shown willingness to call and bet small\n3. The pot is 21 chips and I have a strong hand relative to this board\n4. I should try to extract value\n\nI think I should bet for value here. Two pair is likely good, and I want to get called by worse hands like:\n- Top pair (Jx)\n- Second pair (9x)\n- Maybe a straight draw that missed but they might call with\n\nGiven the pot is 21, a bet of around 50-75% pot would be appropriate. The minimum raise is 4, but that's just to enable the raise action - I can bet any amount from 4 up to my stack.\n\nLet me bet around 12-14 chips for value. This is a decent size that worse hands might call.\n\nActually, looking at the action again - on the turn they bet 4 when I checked. This suggests they have something but it's not super strong. A small bet often means a marginal hand or a probe bet.\n\nI think betting about 12-14 chips makes sense. Let me go with 12 (a bit over half pot) to get called by worse.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. The format requires \"raise_to\" to be the TOTAL amount. So if I want to bet 12, I put \"raise_to\": 12.",

While I have some backdoor draws, the immediate equity is very low. Betting here would be a bluff. Given that:\n1. The opponent sometimes bets on the flop (hand 6), so they might call or raise a bet\n2. I have position advantage\n3. My hand has very little immediate strength\n4. The pot is small (4 chips)\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I don't have enough equity to bet for value, and a bluff might not be successful given the opponent's tendencies. I can see a free card and potentially improve on the turn.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have position and a healthy stack. The board is 3d 8s 4c - very dry, no high cards. My opponent checked preflop as the BB. They could have a wide range of hands. \n\nA small bet could potentially get them to fold hands that are currently ahead of me (like 6x, 7x, 9x, Tx, etc.) but that didn't connect with this board. However, they might also call with any pair or any draw.\n\nGiven the very weak nature of my hand and the fact that I have position, I think checking to see a free card is the better play. If I improve on the turn (hit a diamond, J, or 5), I can reassess.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. With a backdoor flush draw and gutshot, plus position, a small bet could be profitable as a semi-bluff. The board is very dry, so if they missed, they might fold. But the risk is they could have hit this board in many ways (any pair, any 5-6-7 for straight draws, etc.).\n\nI think the conservative approach is best here. Check and see the turn card.",

The board is 3d 8s 4c Jh.\n- I hit top pair with my Jack (Jh on board)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (one diamond on board, one in my hand)\n- I have a backdoor straight draw (45678 possible, but I only have a 5)\n- My kicker is weak (5)\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- This opponent has been relatively tight preflop (folded many hands)\n- When they do play, they often raise preflop (6 chip raises in hands 6, 7, 8)\n- They tend to be aggressive postflop when they enter (bet 8 on flop in hand 6)\n- They've shown willingness to fold on turn and river\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips)\n- My opponent checked the flop\n- I have top pair weak kicker\n- The board is relatively dry (no flush draws, only straight draws like 56, 57, 67)\n- I'm in position\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. I have a decent made hand (top pair)\n2. The board is somewhat coordinated for straights but not super dangerous\n3. My opponent has shown they can be aggressive but checked twice now\n4. I should likely bet for value and protection\n5. I want to charge any draws or weaker pairs\n6. I need to consider my kicker is weak, so I shouldn't overplay\n\n**Bet Sizing:**\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- Minimum raise is 2 (but that's just a min-bet)\n- I should bet around 50-75% of pot for value\n- A bet of 3-4 chips seems appropriate\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should bet for value here. I have top pair and my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice. I want to extract value from weaker pairs, protect against draws, and take control of the hand. I'll make a value bet of about 3 chips (75% of pot).",

So diamonds are: 3d, Qd, and my Jd is hearts. So only 2 diamonds on board: 3d and Qd. No flush possible.\n- Straight possibilities: 3-4-8-J-Q - no straight possible\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a 5 kicker\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I posted SB (1), opponent posted BB (2), everyone else folded, I called 1 more, opponent checked\n- Flop: I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: I bet 7, opponent called 7\n- River: Opponent checked to me\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at Seat 2's actions across 9 hands:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 6/9 times preflop (67% fold rate)\n- When they enter pots: they sometimes raise (6 chips), sometimes call\n- Postflop behavior: Generally passive - checks often, calls bets, rarely initiates action\n- In hand 6: They raised preflop to 6, bet 8 on flop - this was an aggressive line\n- In hand 8: They raised preflop to 6, called 4 on flop, checked turn, folded river\n- Overall pattern: Tight-passive player who occasionally shows aggression with strong hands\n\n**Current river situation:**\n- Opponent checked to me\n- I have top pair (Jacks)\n- The turn went: I bet 7, opponent called 7\n- Opponent called my turn bet after checking flop\n\n**What does opponent's turn call mean?**\nGiven opponent is tight-passive, their turn call likely means:\n1. They have some piece of the board - maybe a Jack with better kicker, or they hit the Q on river\n2. They could have a pocket pair that improved\n3. They could have been drawing but missed\n4. They rarely bluff given passive pattern\n\n**River decision:**\n- Opponent checked to me - this is often a sign of weakness from a passive player, or a trap with a monster\n- Given opponent is tight-passive, checking likely means either:\n  a) They have a marginal hand and want to see showdown cheaply\n  b) They have a very strong hand and are inducing a bet\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker (5)\n- The board is relatively dry: 3-4-8-J-Q\n- No flushes or straights possible\n- I'm likely ahead of any pocket pairs lower than Jacks, any 8s, 4s, 3s\n- I'm behind any Qx (they have top pair), any Jx with better kicker\n\n**Given the opponent's tight-passive pattern:**\n- They would likely have bet the river if they had a Queen (top pair)\n- They would likely have bet the river if they had a Jack with good kicker\n- Their check suggests either weakness or a slow-played monster\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 196 chips (98 BB) - healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- However, there's 18 in the pot and checking gives a free showdown\n\n**Decision:**\nI should value bet here. The opponent's tight-passive pattern suggests they'll call with worse hands like:\n- Pocket pairs (99, TT)\n- Any 8x, 4x, 3x\n- Maybe even Ace-high if they're sticky\n- They might fold if they have complete air\n\nA small value bet is appropriate. The pot is 18, so a bet of 7-10 chips makes sense.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider that the opponent called my turn bet. What hands would they call turn with?\n- They could have a Jack (but I'd lose to better kickers)\n- They could have a pocket pair\n- They could have picked up a straight draw with 5-6 or 6-7 (but missed)\n- They could have had two overcards\n\nGiven they checked river after calling turn, they likely don't have a Queen. They might have a Jack with marginal kicker.\n\n**Final decision:**\nI should make a thin value bet. Given the pot is 18, a bet of 7-9 chips is appropriate. I'll go with 8 chips"

It has almost no potential to make strong hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is advantageous, but it's not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. These are not good enough for a hand this weak.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack of 107 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks. Folding weak hands preserves my stack for better spots.\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies**: The blinds seem to be playing relatively straightforward based on the limited data.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. 7-2 offsuit should be folded in virtually all situations, even on the button. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suited potential\n- No connected potential\n- Very low probability of making a straight or flush\n- Even if I pair one of my cards, I'll likely be outkicked\n\nEven though I'm on the button with good position, the hand is just too weak to justify even a 2-chip call. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Details:**\n- My position: BTN (Button) - Seat 1\n- My cards: 2h As (Ace of spades, 2 of hearts)\n- My stack: 212 chips (106 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 4 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted SB (1 chip)\n- I posted BB (2 chips)\n- Seats 2, 3, 4 all folded\n- Seat 5 called the additional 1 chip to match the BB\n\nSo now it's back to me on the Button (which is also the BB position in this case since everyone else folded). I can check or raise.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n- In hand 13, they called preflop, then checked flop and turn, then folded on turn\n\nThis suggests they're a conservative player who doesn't play many hands. Their call here likely indicates some hand strength, but not a premium hand (since they didn't raise).\n\n**My Hand:**\nI have A2 offsuit. This is a marginal hand:\n- Pros: I have an Ace, which is good. Position on the button.\n- Cons: Weak kicker (2). Offsuit. In a heads-up situation, Ace-rag can be problematic if an Ace hits and they have a better kicker.\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n- It's heads-up (me vs Seat 5)\n- I'm in position (acting last postflop)\n- Pot is small (4 chips)\n- I have a strong stack (212 chips)\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Marginal. A2o is not great, but it's heads-up and I have position.\n2. **Position**: Excellent. I'm on the button, so I act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight player who just called. They likely have a decent hand but not premium.\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 4, it costs me 0 to check. Checking is free.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks, but also no pressure.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: See a free flop with my A2o. This is low risk. I have position and can evaluate postflop.\n- **Raise**: Try to take down the pot now. However, against a tight player who called, a raise might only get called by better hands. Minimum raise to 4 would be a 2 chip raise.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI should check here. Here's why:\n- My hand is marginal and I can see a free flop\n- I have position, which is valuable postflop\n- The opponent is tight - if I raise, I'll likely only get action from better hands\n- The pot is small, so there's no urgency to protect or build it\n- I can evaluate postflop based on board texture and opponent's action\n\nChecking keeps the pot small with my marginal hand while maintaining the advantage of position. If I hit an Ace on the flop, I need to be cautious about my kicker. If I hit a 2, I'll have a pair but it's a low pair.\n\nLet me formulate the JSON response.",

They rarely enter pots, and when they do, they play passively. The fact that they're betting on the flop here suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 10, I need to call 6\n- Pot odds: 16:6 or about 2.67:1\n- This means I need ~27% equity to call\n\n**Board Texture:**\n- Very dangerous board with K-Q-9\n- Many possible strong hands: KQ, K9, Q9, sets, two pairs\n- Possible straight draws (JT)\n- I have no draw and no pair\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the button, which is good position\n- But without any hand strength or draws, position doesn't help much here\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. I only have Ace-high with no draw\n2. The board is highly coordinated and dangerous\n3. Opponent is very tight and is betting into me (indicating strength)\n4. I need to call 6 chips with very little chance of winning\n5. Even if I hit an Ace on turn or river, I could still be behind to many hands\n\nI should fold. Calling here would be throwing away chips with a very weak hand against a tight opponent showing strength.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the situation:\n\n1. My hand: 5h 6d - This is a weak suited connector (not suited, actually offsuit). 5-6 offsuit is a very marginal hand, especially from the button.\n\n2. Position: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This gives me advantage.\n\n3. Stack size: I have 211 chips (105.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. Pot odds: Only 1 chip to call to win 3 chips (getting 3:1 odds).\n\n5. Opponent tendencies: Looking at Kimi-K2's actions from the recall:\n   - Very tight player - folds preflop frequently (hands 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14)\n   - When they do enter pots, they often raise to 6 (hands 6, 7, 8, 12)\n   - They play straightforward post-flop (bet flop, then check/fold turn/river in hand 8)\n   - They called a turn bet in hand 10 but folded river\n\n6. Tournament considerations: With a healthy stack of 105 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should be looking for better opportunities.\n\n7. The action: Everyone folded to me on the button. I can complete the blind for 1 chip or raise.\n\nAnalysis:\n- 5-6 offsuit is a very weak hand that will rarely make strong hands\n- Even though I'm getting good pot odds (3:1), the hand has poor equity against any reasonable BB defending range\n- The BB (Kimi-K2) is tight and will likely defend with better hands\n- From the button, I could consider a steal raise, but against a tight player who folds a lot preflop, this might work\n- However, if called, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position post-flop (the BB will have position on me)\n- My hand has very little showdown value and poor playability\n\nThe best play here is to fold. While the pot odds are tempting, 5-6 offsuit is just too weak to play profitably, even from the button. I should wait for better spots with my healthy stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Alright, let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Hand: 8\u2660 8\u2666 - Pocket 8s, a medium pocket pair\n- Stack: 211 chips (105.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n- Min raise: 4 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): SB position, 187 chips. Recent actions show they fold a lot preflop (hands 9, 11, 13, 14, 15) but they did raise to 6 in hand 12. They seem tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): BB position, 222 chips. Very tight - has folded preflop in 8 out of 10 recent actions. Only raised once (hand 13) and showed aggression post-flop in that hand.\n\n**My recent play:** I've been very tight, folding 12 out of 15 hands. This means I likely have a tight image.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket 8s is a strong hand, especially from the button. It's vulnerable to overcards but has good potential.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents:** Both opponents seem tight. The SB folds a lot, and the BB is extremely tight.\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 105.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips.\n5. **Pot odds:** Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is fine for pocket 8s.\n\n**Decision:** With a medium pocket pair on the button against two tight opponents, I should definitely play this hand. I have two options:\n\n- **Call (2 chips):** Play cautiously, see the flop. Risk is low, but I give the BB a chance to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n- **Raise:** Take control of the hand. A standard raise would be 3x-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips.\n\nGiven that both opponents are tight and I have a tight image, a raise makes sense. It:\n1. Builds the pot when I likely have the best hand\n2. Gets value from hands that might call (like Ax, Kx, Qx, smaller pairs)\n3. Takes control of the hand\n4. Capitalizes on my tight image\n\nA raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. Let me go with 6 chips (3x BB) as it's the standard size and keeps my risk manageable.\n\n**Final decision:** Raise to 6 chips.",

Let me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: J2o is one of the weakest starting hands in poker. It has very poor playability post-flop, no suited potential, and the cards are not connected.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on every street post-flop with no information about opponents' actions.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 107 BB, so I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Early tournament play favors tight play and preserving chips. I should only play strong hands from early position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 (1.5:1), which is not relevant since this hand is too weak to play regardless.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: The search didn't return results for UTG raises, but that doesn't change the fundamental weakness of this hand.\n\nStandard poker strategy says to fold J2o from UTG 100% of the time. It's simply not a profitable hand to play from this position. Even if the table is very passive and I could see a cheap flop, the reverse implied odds are terrible - when I hit something, I'm likely to be dominated.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for better opportunities.",

Hand strength: K4o is a weak hand, but the King has some value. In position on the button, this is a borderline hand.\n2. Position: BTN is the best position - I get to act last postflop\n3. Opponent: Very tight player in BB, likely has a strong range when they defend\n4. Pot odds: 3:1 to call, which is good\n5. Tournament: Stack is healthy, can afford to see flops in position\n\nWith a tight opponent in the BB, I could try to steal with a raise. However, since they're tight, they might only call/raise with strong hands. \n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too tight, I have position and good pot odds\n- Call: Cheap to see flop in position, but hand is weak\n- Raise: Steal attempt. Min raise is to 4. Could raise to 5-6.\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness (folding 80% preflop), a steal attempt seems profitable. If they call, I have position. If they re-raise, I can fold easily.\n\nI think a small raise to 5 or 6 chips is the best play here. It's a good stealing spot against a tight BB defender.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: 2c Th - This is a very weak hand. Ten-high with a terrible kicker (2c).\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Good position, but doesn't make up for the terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 220 chips (55 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: It's folded to me on the button. SB and BB are the only players left.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 13, 14, 16, 18, 19). Called in hands 17 and 20. Raised once in hand 12. Seems relatively tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Very tight! Folded preflop in hands 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. That's 7 consecutive folds! Only played hand 13 where they reached showdown with Q3s. This player is extremely tight.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. I don't have that with T2o.\n\n**Decision**: Even though I'm on the button and the blinds seem tight (especially BB who folds 87.5% of the time based on recent data), T2o is just too weak to play. The SB could defend, and even if they both fold often, the times they don't I'll be in bad shape.\n\nI should fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot. It's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, no need to get involved with such a weak holding.\n\n**Action**: Fold",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: UTG (Seat 1) - worst position\n- Cards: 8h Jc (offsuit, marginal hand)\n- Stack: 220 chips (55 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n8h Jc is a marginal hand, especially from UTG position. It's not connected, not suited, and has poor playability post-flop. This is typically a fold from early position.\n\n**Position considerations:**\nUTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act post-flop. This means I have no information about opponents' intentions and could face multiple raises behind me.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nLooking at the opponent data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I see:\n- Mostly folds preflop (5 out of 7 hands)\n- Occasionally calls (2 out of 7 hands)\n- Recently raised to 12 chips in hands 21 and 22\n- Seems to be playing relatively tight\n\n**My recent play:**\nLooking at my last 5 hands:\n- Hand 18: UTG with Th 9s - folded preflop\n- Hand 19: BB with Ks 5d - won (likely everyone folded)\n- Hand 20: SB with 4c Kd - won with trips (hit miracle flop)\n- Hand 21: BTN with 2c Th - folded preflop\n- Hand 22: CO with 4h Qs - folded preflop\n\nI've been playing relatively tight, which is good.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (55 BB)\n- Blinds are 2/4, so I can afford to be patient\n- No need to risk chips with marginal hands from bad position\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 8J offsuit from UTG is not a profitable hand, especially with a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe minimum raise to 8 chips would be a bad idea - it's too small to fold out opponents and I'd be playing a weak hand out of position. Calling 4 chips would also be unprofitable with this hand from UTG.\n\n**Final decision: FOLD**",

Seems tight/passive. When they do play, they make small bets (2 chips on turn/river in hand 18).\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also very tight preflop, folding most hands (19-22), only played hand 23 where they checked and then bet 4 on turn. Made a small raise here.\n\n**Pot odds**: Calling 4 to win 16 = 4:1 odds, which is good for a speculative hand like TJo.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. TJo offsuit is marginal, especially OOP\n2. I'm getting good immediate pot odds\n3. Both opponents seem tight/passive\n4. If I hit a strong hand, I can likely get value from these passive players\n5. My stack is healthy enough to take a speculative call\n6. I'm out of position which is a disadvantage\n\n**Decision**: Calling seems reasonable here. The raise is small (min-raise), I'm getting good odds, and the opponents seem passive enough that I won't face difficult pressure postflop. I don't want to 3-bet with TJo OOP against two players, and folding seems too tight given the price.\n\nLet me call.",

The board is Qs Th 2d 5s. \n- Possible hands that beat me: Any queen (top pair), any two pair, sets, straights (unlikely with this board)\n- I have 4 outs to two pair (any jack), giving me ~8% equity\n- The board is relatively dry with no flush draws and only possible straight draws (KJ, J9, 43)\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall:\n- **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB):** Has been relatively passive, but is now betting aggressively. They raised preflop, bet flop, and now bet 50 on turn. This suggests they have a strong hand. They've shown aggression before but not consistently.\n\n- **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):** Has been folding a lot preflop. Called preflop, called flop, but hasn't shown much aggression. They called flop bet of 20 which could mean they have something but not super strong.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 134, I need to call 50.\nPot odds = 134:50 or 2.68:1\nI need ~27% equity to call profitably.\n\nI only have ~8% equity with my 4 outs to two pair. This is not enough to call based on pot odds alone.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 192 chips left. If I call 50, I'll have 142 left. If I raise, minimum is 100 which puts a lot of pressure on my stack.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. I only have middle pair with weak kicker\n2. GPT-OSS-120B is showing significant aggression (raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn)\n\n\n3. I don't have enough pot odds to call\n4. My hand has very limited improvement potential\n5. Raising would be a semi-bluff at best, but would commit too much of my stack\n\nI'll fold this hand. The aggressive betting from GPT-OSS-120B suggests they have a stronger hand, and my pot odds don't justify continuing. Protecting my stack is crucial in this tournament situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: Ah 9s (Ace of hearts, 9 of spades) - decent hand, Ace-high\n- Stack: 190 chips (47.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n- Min raise: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nLooking at the opponent actions, I can see:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24)\n- When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 12, 21, 22)\n- They made a big raise to 12 in hands 21 and 22\n- In hand 22 they also bet 20 on the flop\n- They seem to be playing somewhat tight-aggressive when they do enter pots\n\n**My Recent History:**\n- I've been playing fairly tight (18 folds out of 24 hands)\n- I've had some success with raises (won with 88 in hand 16, won with 44 in hand 20)\n- Last hand (24) I called preflop with Td Jc and called a flop bet before folding on turn\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: A9o is a decent but not premium hand. It's good enough to play from the button.\n2. **Position**: Button is the best position - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: The BB seems to fold a lot preflop, so there's fold equity.\n4. **Pot Odds**: Calling 2 to win 6 = 3:1 pot odds, which is good for A9.\n5. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy 47.5 BB, can afford to play this hand.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from the button with A9o. This would be overly cautious.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. I see a flop in position with a decent hand. Risk is small (2 chips).\n- **Raise**: Also reasonable. I have fold equity against a tight opponent, and I can take control of the hand. Min raise is 8 chips.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button, have a tight image, and the opponent folds a lot preflop, I think a raise is the best play. It gives me fold equity, and if called, I have position and a hand that can hit strong top pairs.\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips, but the minimum is 8. I should raise to at least 12 to make it a real raise. Given my stack and the opponent's tendency to fold, I could even go to 14-16.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x BB), which is a standard size and puts pressure on the tight BB.",

This is a decent but not great hand, especially in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: I have 180 chips (45 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - I raised to 12 from the button (3x BB standard raise)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) re-raised to 32 (a 3-bet)\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 20 chips (I already invested 12, need to add 20 more to call 32 total)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: There's 44 in the pot + my 12 + their 32 = 88 chips. I need to call 20, so getting 88:20 or about 4.4:1 odds.\n\n7. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding preflop many times\n   - They've made some raises (hands 12, 21, 22) \n   - In hand 22, they raised preflop to 12 and then bet 20 on the flop, showing aggression\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly - when they raise, they likely have a strong hand\n   - No showdown data available\n\n8. **Hand strength**: A9o is marginal against a 3-bet. Against a typical 3-betting range (JJ+, AQ+, maybe some bluffs), A9o is in bad shape. Even if they're 3-betting lighter, I'm dominated by many hands (AT+, AJ+, AQ+, AK).\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: With 45 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can wait for better opportunities. Calling here would put 32 chips in the pot (18% of my stack) with a marginal hand out of position for my opponent postflop (they'll be acting first).\n\n10. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. A9o is too weak to call a 3-bet, even with position. The opponent's raise to 32 suggests strength, and I don't have the pot odds or implied odds to justify calling with this hand. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

Take advantage of my position\n\nStandard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. Given the SB's tendency to make big raises, I could go a bit larger to discourage them from 3-betting light. Let me raise to 12 or maybe 14-16.\n\nActually, looking at the pattern:\n- When SB raises, they go to 12 (3x) or 32 (8x)\n- The BB folds a LOT (only called once in last 10 hands)\n\nI should raise to about 12-14 chips.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Ah Tc (Ace of hearts, Ten of clubs)\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n**Stack**: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n**Blinds**: 2/4\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**To call**: 4 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ah Tc is a decent hand but it's offsuit and from early position, it's marginal. This is typically a fold from UTG in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players behind me who can act. If I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by better hands.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have a decent stack at 46.5 BB, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Recent Opponent Behavior** (from the recall):\n   - MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB) has been calling raises and playing post-flop (called 8 preflop, called 20 and 50 on flop/turn in hand 24)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been aggressive (raised to 8 preflop in hand 24, then bet 20 and 50 on flop/turn)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3, SB) has been folding a lot\n   - Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been folding and raising occasionally\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 46.5 BB, I'm in decent shape. Playing marginal hands from early position is a recipe for losing chips unnecessarily.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1 odds. That's not particularly relevant here since it's just the big blind.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold from UTG. Ah Tc is too weak to open from early position. If I raise, I'm likely to get action from better hands. If I call, I'm playing a marginal hand out of position against multiple opponents. The best play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThis is especially true given that MiniMax-M2 in the BB seems to defend their blind and play post-flop, so if I raise, I'm likely to get called and play a big pot out of position with a marginal hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: UTG (worst position)\n- Hand: 8d 4h (utter trash, unsuited and unconnected)\n- Stack: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Need to call: 4 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n8-4 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has:\n- No high card value\n- Not suited\n- Not connected (gap of 4)\n- Very low chance of making a straight or flush\n- Even if you hit a pair, it's a weak pair\n\n**Position Analysis:**\nUTG is the worst position - you have to act first on every street, giving opponents maximum information about your hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Very tight, folding most hands preflop (8 folds out of 10 actions)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Mixed, some calls and folds, played a hand to showdown in hand 24\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): More aggressive, has raised preflop and bet postflop, but also folds sometimes\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- With 46.5 BB, I'm in decent shape but not deep stacked\n- This is a tournament, so chip preservation is important\n- From UTG, I need a very strong hand to play\n- Calling 4 chips to win 6 chips means I need 40% equity, which 84o doesn't have against any reasonable range\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 84 offsuit from UTG is unplayable even in a loose cash game, and especially in a tournament where you want to preserve your chips for better spots. The hand has almost no post-flop playability and you're out of position.\n\nThe only consideration might be if the table is extremely passive and I could see a cheap flop, but even then, 84o is just too weak to justify putting chips in from UTG.",

My hand is terrible, I'm out of position, the original raiser is showing extreme strength, and I have no need to gamble with 45.5 BB. The implied odds are poor because even if I hit my hand, I'm unlikely to get paid off significantly, and I could be dominated.\n\nEven though the pot odds are 3.2:1, with such a weak hand and facing a likely premium hand from DeepSeek, I should fold.",

Seems to be playing a wide range.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 - BB):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Extremely tight/foldy preflop: folded in hands 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30\n- Only raised once: hand 29 to 16 chips\n- In hand 29: raised preflop, bet 25 on flop, then gave up (checked turn and river)\n- Showdowns: Qd 3d (weak hand), Ks Ah (strong hand)\n- Pattern: Very tight preflop, only plays premium hands. When they do play, they're aggressive postflop.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n\n**My Hand: J\u2665 3\u2663**\n- This is a trash hand. Offsuite, low kicker, no connectivity.\n- On the button, I could theoretically steal blinds, but...\n- SB is aggressive and likely to defend or re-raise\n- BB is very tight and will only continue with premium hands\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Getting 1.5:1 pot odds\n- Need 40% equity to call profitably\n\n**Equity Analysis:**\n- J3o has about 35-40% equity against random hands\n- Against SB's wide range: maybe 40-45%\n- Against BB's tight range: maybe 25-30%\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm in decent shape with 45 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Preserve stack for better opportunities\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak (J3o)\n2. **Position**: On button is good, but...\n3. **Opponents**: SB is aggressive, BB is very tight\n4. **Pot odds**: Marginal at best\n5. **Stack preservation**: Important\n\n**Strategic Options:**\n\n**Option 1: Fold**\n- Safest play\n- Preserve 180 chip stack\n- Wait for better hand\n- No risk involved\n\n**Option 2: Call (4 chips)**\n- Pot odds are marginal\n- Could see flop and try to hit something\n- But with J3o, hitting the flop is unlikely\n- Even if I hit a J, I'm often dominated by better kickers\n- If I hit a 3, it's unlikely to be good\n- Postflop playability is terrible\n\n**Option 3: Raise (steal attempt)**\n- On button, raising to 8-12 chips could steal blinds\n- But SB is aggressive and likely to defend or re-raise\n- BB is tight and will fold anything but premium hands\n- Risk: If SB re-raises, I'm forced to fold and lose chips\n- If SB calls, I'm out of position postflop with trash hand\n\n**Best Decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis, **folding is the clear best option**:\n- My hand is trash (J3o)\n- SB is aggressive and likely to defend\n- BB is tight and will only continue with hands that crush me\n- No need to risk chips with marginal hand\n- Preserve stack for better spots\n\nThe pot odds aren't compelling enough to call with such a weak hand, and a steal attempt is risky against an aggressive SB who has shown willingness to raise preflop.\n\n**Final Decision: Fold**",

It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights or pairs.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is good position post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 176 chips (44 BB) - This is a healthy stack size.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot is 10 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) called the 4 chip big blind\n- Everyone else folded\n- It's back to me in BB with no additional amount to call (I already posted the BB)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLet me look at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data I retrieved:\n- In hand 29: Called 25 on flop, then checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 30: Folded preflop\n- Hand 31: Folded preflop\n- Hand 32: Called 8 preflop, then bet 20 on flop (aggressive post-flop)\n- Hand 33: Called 2 preflop (SB), checked flop, bet 4 on turn\n\nFrom this pattern:\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop with a fairly wide range (called in 3 out of 4 hands where they entered)\n- They can be aggressive post-flop (hand 32 they bet 20 on flop)\n- They also show some passive tendencies (hand 29 they checked down)\n- Overall, they seem like a moderately active player\n\n**Pot odds:** There's 10 chips in the pot and I can check for free, so I'm getting infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n\n**Hand equity:** With 9s Td, I have about 45-50% equity against a typical calling range from that position. Since I can see the flop for free, checking is definitely profitable.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. **Checking:** This is the safe play. I get to see a free flop with a marginal hand. If I hit something strong (pair+good kicker, straight draw, flush draw), I can proceed. If I miss completely, I can fold with minimal loss.\n \nI'll consider raising as a strategic option to apply pressure. MiniMax-M2 has shown some vulnerability, folding multiple preflop hands. A raise could potentially win the pot immediately or put me in a stronger position post-flop. However, my hand's strength is marginal, which makes this a higher-risk play. The key is balancing potential aggression with the limitations of my current hand.\n\nThe optimal move seems to be a conservative check. I'll see the flop without investing additional chips, allowing me to assess the board's potential and make a more informed decision based on the community cards.\n\nChecking provides maximum flexibility with minimal risk, perfectly aligning with my current strategic approach.",

It's just me vs MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4.\n\n**Stack sizes**: \n- Me: 176 chips (44 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2: 124 chips (31 BB)\n\n**Pot**: 10 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n- They tend to call preflop fairly often (hands 27, 29, 32, 33)\n- They check frequently on flops and turns\n- They've made some bets: hand 32 flop bet of 20, hand 33 turn bet of 4\n- They seem to play somewhat passively but can bet when they have something\n\n**My decision**: I have a strong hand (two pair) but the board is very wet with flush and straight possibilities. I should bet for value and to protect my hand against draws. I need to charge any flush draws or straight draws.\n\nGiven the pot is 10 chips, a bet of around 2/3 pot (6-8 chips) would be appropriate. This will charge draws and get value from worse hands like top pair, weaker two pairs, or maybe even a lower set.\n\nI should bet to protect my hand.",

This is a very dangerous board for me because:\n1. I only have the 9s, so any heart beats my two pair\n2. The Th is on board, so someone could have AhXh, KhXh, QhXh, JhXh\n3. Someone could also have a straight flush draw with 8h6h\n\n**My hand:** Two pair (tens and nines). This is strong on a non-flush board, but very vulnerable here.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from seat 4\n- Flop: I bet 8, MiniMax-M2 called 8\n- Turn: It's on me to act, I can check\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They call preflop frequently (hands 27, 29, 32, 33)\n- They check-call on flop/turn (hand 27, 29)\n- They sometimes lead bet (hand 32 flop bet 20, hand 33 turn bet 4)\n- They haven't shown any big aggression patterns\n- They seem to be a calling station type who likes to see cards\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: My two pair is likely beating any non-flush hand, but loses to any heart. Given the 4 hearts on board, the probability opponent has at least one heart is high.\n\n2. **Board texture**: Extremely dangerous with 4 hearts. Anyone with any heart has a flush.\n\n3. **Pot size**: 26 chips is relatively small compared to stacks.\n\n4. **Opponent's action**: They called my flop bet. This could mean:\n   - They have a flush and are trapping\n   - They have a strong hand like a set or two pair\n   - They have a draw (straight draw, or one heart hoping for a flush)\n   - They have top pair or medium pair\n\n5. **My position**: I'm out of position which is bad for hand reading.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 168 chips, opponent has 116. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot.\n\n**The key question**: Should I check or bet?\n\nIf I bet:\n- A flush will likely raise me\n- A draw might call\n- A weaker hand might fold\n- I'm building a pot with a vulnerable hand\n\nIf I check:\n- I can see a free river card\n- If opponent bets, I have a tough decision but can fold if the bet is large\n- I keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n\nGiven that there are 4 hearts on board and I have none, the probability my opponent has at least one heart is significant. In fact, with 4 hearts on board, any random hand has a ~19% chance of containing at least one heart (9 hearts left in deck, 44 unknown cards).\n\nBut more importantly, the fact that they called my flop bet on a 3-heart board suggests they might have had a flush draw or already had a flush.\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. This is a clear check/fold situation if facing significant aggression. My hand is too vulnerable, and I don't want to build a big pot with just two pair when 4 hearts are out there. I should check and see what opponent does, ready to fold to any substantial bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have TWO PAIR with Tens and Nines. The board is Th 9h 7h 2h. So I have top two pair. But any heart beats me.\n\nWait, I need to think about the opponent's range more carefully. What hands would call preflop and then call a flop bet on a 3-heart board?\n- Any heart (flush draw)\n- Sets (77, 99, TT)\n- Two pair (T9, T7, 97)\n- Top pair with good kicker\n- Straight draws (86, J8)\n\nGiven the opponent is a calling station based on their history, they could have a wide range.\n\nBut with 4 hearts now on board, if they have ANY heart, they have a flush. That's extremely likely given they called on the flop when there were 3 hearts.\n\nThe fact that I have the Th on board means the Ah, Kh, Qh, Jh are all potentially in their hand.\n\nI think checking is"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 9s Td (I have two pair - tens and nines)\n- Board: Th 9h 7h 2h (four hearts on board)\n- Pot: 26 chips\n- My stack: 168 chips (42 BB)\n- Position: BB\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 116 chips\n\n**Board analysis:**\nThe board shows 4 hearts (Th, 9h, 7h, 2h). This is a very dangerous board for me because:\n1. I only have the 9s, so any heart beats my two pair\n2. The Th is on board, so someone could have AhXh, KhXh, QhXh, JhXh\n3. Someone could also have a straight flush draw with 8h6h\n\n**My hand:** Two pair (tens and nines). This is strong on a non-flush board, but very vulnerable here.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from seat 4\n- Flop: I bet 8, MiniMax-M2 called 8\n- Turn: It's on me to act, I can check\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They call preflop frequently (hands 27, 29, 32, 33)\n- They check-call on flop/turn (hand 27, 29)\n- They sometimes lead bet (hand 32 flop bet 20, hand 33 turn bet 4)\n- They haven't shown any big aggression patterns\n- They seem to be a calling station type who likes to see cards\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: My two pair is likely beating any non-flush hand, but loses to any heart. Given the 4 hearts on board, the probability opponent has at least one heart is high.\n\n2. **Board texture**: Extremely dangerous with 4 hearts. Anyone with any heart has a flush.\n\n3. **Pot size**: 26 chips is relatively small compared to stacks.\n\n4. **Opponent's action**: They called my flop bet. This could mean:\n   - They have a flush and are trapping\n   - They have a strong hand like a set or two pair\n   - They have a draw (straight draw, or one heart hoping for a flush)\n   - They have top pair or medium pair\n\n5. **My position**: I'm out of position which is bad for hand reading.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 168 chips, opponent has 116. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot.\n\n**The key question**: Should I check or bet?\n\nIf I bet:\n- A flush will likely raise me\n- A draw might call\n- A weaker hand might fold\n- I'm building a pot with a vulnerable hand\n\nIf I check:\n- I can see a free river card\n- If opponent bets, I have a tough decision but can fold if the bet is large\n- I keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n\nGiven that there are 4 hearts on board and I have none, the probability my opponent has at least one heart is significant. In fact, with 4 hearts on board, any random hand has a ~19% chance of containing at least one heart (9 hearts left in deck, 44 unknown cards).\n\nBut more importantly, the fact that they called my flop bet on a 3-heart board suggests they might have had a flush draw or already had a flush.\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. This is a clear check/fold situation if facing significant aggression. My hand is too vulnerable, and I don't want to build a big pot with just two pair when 4 hearts are out there. I should check and see what opponent does, ready to fold to any substantial bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have TWO PAIR with Tens and Nines. The board is Th 9h 7h 2h. So I have top two pair. But any heart beats me.\n\nWait, I need to think about the opponent's range more carefully. What hands would call preflop and then call a flop bet on a 3-heart board?\n- Any heart (flush draw)\n- Sets (77, 99, TT)\n- Two pair (T9, T7, 97)\n- Top pair with good kicker\n- Straight draws (86, J8)\n\nGiven the opponent is a calling station based on their history, they could have a wide range.\n\nBut with 4 hearts now on board, if they have ANY heart, they have a flush. That's extremely likely given they called on the flop when there were 3 hearts.\n\nThe fact that I have the Th on board means the Ah, Kh, Qh, Jh are all potentially in their hand.\n\nI think checking is",

Anyone with any heart beats my two pair.\n2. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2, who has shown calling station tendencies\n3. **Action**: They called my flop bet when there were 3 hearts on board\n4. **Hand strength**: My two pair is strong in absolute terms but extremely vulnerable\n\n**Decision logic:**\n- With 4 hearts on board, the probability opponent has at least one heart is very high\n- They called on the flop with 3 hearts, suggesting they might have had a flush draw or already made a flush\n- Betting here would be building a pot with a marginal hand that loses to any heart\n- Checking is the prudent play - I can see a free river card and keep the pot small\n- If opponent bets after I check, I should likely fold unless it's a very small bet\n\n**Conclusion**: I should check. There's no point in betting and building a pot when I'm likely behind to any opponent who has a heart (which is very likely given the board texture and their flop call).\n\nLet me format this as a JSON response properly.",

My two pair is vulnerable to:\n- Any heart (flush)\n- Any J or 8 (straight)\n- Any T (better two pair)\n- Any 9 (better two pair with higher kicker)\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2 - Seat 4):**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 shows these patterns:\n- Often calls preflop (hands 27, 29, 32, 33)\n- Has shown down with hands like As7s, Ac8d, AcJh - seems to play suited Aces and some broadway cards\n- In hand 32, they bet 20 on flop after calling preflop\n- In hand 33, they bet 4 on turn\n- Generally seems to be a straightforward player who bets when they have something\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: They called 4\n- Flop: I bet 8, they called 8 (board: Th 9h 7h)\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 8 (board: Th 9h 7h 2h)\n\nThe turn card is 2h, completing the flush draw. Their bet of 8 into a pot of 26 is about 31% pot.\n\n**My Decision:**\nI'm facing 8 to call in a pot of 34 (about 24% pot odds).\n\nMy hand is two pair, but I'm very vulnerable. The opponent's pattern suggests they likely have:\n1. A made flush (any heart)\n2. A straight (with J8)\n3. A set or better two pair\n4. Possibly a bluff or semi-bluff with one heart trying to push me off\n\nGiven that they called the flop bet on a very wet board (Th 9h 7h), they likely have something. The turn bet after I checked suggests strength.\n\nWith my stack of 168 chips, I have plenty of chips to fold and wait for better spots. This is a tournament where chip preservation is important. Calling here would be marginal at best, and I could lose a significant portion of my stack.\n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for a better situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s 7h - Pocket sevens. A medium pocket pair.\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position post-flop)\n3. **Stack**: 166 chips (41.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from the CO position\n5. **Pot**: 14 chips, need to call 6 more\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 7 out of 10 recent hands\n- Only raised once before (hand #30) when they raised to 12\n- They seem to be playing very conservatively\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Pocket sevens is a decent hand but vulnerable to overcards\n- We're out of position which is a big disadvantage\n- The raise is small (8 into a pot of 6) - only 2x the BB\n- We have a healthy stack and could call to see a flop\n- However, we're in SB and will be first to act post-flop\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 6 to win 14, getting ~2.3:1. Not great for a pair that needs to hit a set to be confident.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 41.5 BB, we have room to play. Set mining is possible, but we need good implied odds.\n\n**Opponent read**: GPT-OSS-120B seems tight, so their raise range is probably strong. They might have higher pairs or big cards that dominate us.\n\nGiven our position and the opponent's tight image, I think this is a fold. We're out of position with a medium pair against what appears to be a tight player. The pot odds aren't great for set mining (we'd need ~10:1 implied odds typically), and being first to act post-flop multiplies our disadvantage.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc 7s (Queen of clubs, 7 of spades) - This is a mediocre hand. It's offsuit and not connected. Q7o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, the best at the table. Being on the button means I act last postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 166 chips (41.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack, not short-stacked yet.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Players left:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 222 chips (55.5 BB)\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 198 chips (49.5 BB)\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\n\nKimi-K2 (Seat 2/SB):\n- Recent pattern shows mostly folding preflop (folded in hands 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35)\n- Has raised preflop a couple times (hand 28: raised to 16, hand 32: raised to 12)\n- In hand 32, raised preflop to 12 but folded on the flop\n- Showdown hand 27 with K9s - seems to play some speculative hands\n- Overall: Relatively tight, folds frequently, but capable of raising\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3/BB):\n- Very tight pattern - has folded preflop in hands 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35\n- Only showed aggression in hand 29: raised preflop to 16, then bet 25 on flop, checked turn and river\n- Showdown hand 29 with AKs - strong hand\n- Showdown hand 13 with Q3s - questionable hand selection\n- Overall: Very tight, folds most hands, only plays strong hands aggressively\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Q7o is weak. I should fold this most of the time.\n\n\n2. **Positional advantage offers minimal value with such a weak hand. The potential to steal blinds exists, but opponents' tendencies suggest caution. Button position can't compensate for poor card quality.**\n\n3. **Opponent behaviors reveal tight playing styles. Both players frequently fold, indicating potential for strategic aggression. However, their tightness suggests they'll only engage with strong hands.**\n\n4. **Stealing risk assessment shows moderate potential. Small blind and big blind have demonstrated willingness to fold, but could defend unexpectedly.**\n\n5. **Stack preservation becomes crucial. With 41.5 BB, maintaining chip integrity is more valuable than marginal blind-stealing attempts.**\n\n6. **Tournament strategy emphasizes survival and strategic chip accumulation. Risking chips on weak hands contradicts long-term tournament success principles.**\n\n7. **Alternative approach recommends conservative play: fold the hand, observe opponent reactions, and wait for more favorable opportunities.",

This raise to 8 seems unusual for them.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mixes between folding and raising to 8. They've raised to 8 in hands 35 and 38, and called here. In hand 38, they checked down and made a small river bet.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 3d 4d is a low suited connector\n- Very weak hand that rarely makes strong holdings\n- Even when it hits, it's often dominated\n- From SB, this is a clear fold in most situations\n\n**Position:**\n- In SB, we're out of position for the entire hand\n- This makes it harder to realize equity\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 6 to win 22 (3.67:1)\n- This might seem reasonable, but with this hand from this position, it's not enough\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have 41.5 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 34s from SB facing a raise and a call is not a profitable play. We're out of position with a weak hand that rarely makes the nuts. Even though the price seems okay, the combination of hand strength, position, and tournament considerations makes this an easy fold.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2 is suspicious given their tight history, but that doesn't make 34s good enough to call. If anything, it suggests they might have a real hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 - SB):**\n- Has been raising to 12 chips frequently (hands 32, 36, 37)\n- Also folds a lot preflop (hands 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40)\n- In hand 32, they raised preflop but folded on the flop\n- Showed down K9s in hand 27\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 - BB):**\n- Has folded EVERY SINGLE preflop hand in the last 10 hands (hands 30, 32-40)\n- This is extremely tight play\n- However, they showed down strong hands in the past: Q3o (won in hand 13) and AKs (won in hand 29)\n\n**My situation:**\n- Cards: 3d 9h (very weak, offsuit, not connected, low cards)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 166 chips (20.8 BB) - this is a decent stack but not deep\n- Need to call 8 chips to see flop\n\nThe pot is 12 chips, and I need to call 8. That's pot odds of 12:8 or 1.5:1. I need 40% equity to justify a call.\n\nWith 93o against random hands, I have about 35-40% equity, but:\n1. The SB has shown they can raise with decent hands\n2. The BB has been extremely tight, folding everything recently\n3. My hand has almost no playability postflop - no suitedness, no connectivity, low cards\n4. Even if I hit a 9, I'm often dominated by better 9s\n5. If I hit a 3, it's almost never good\n\nGiven the BB's extreme tightness (folding 10 hands in a row), there's a chance they might defend their blind here, but it's unlikely. The SB could have a wide range but has shown they can raise.\n\nWith my weak hand and the need to preserve my 20BB stack in a tournament, this is a clear fold. The position advantage doesn't compensate for such a weak holding. I should wait for better spots, especially given that I have enough chips to be patient.\n\nI could consider a steal raise since the BB is so tight, but:\n- The SB has shown they can raise/call\n- 93o is too weak to raise with\n- If I raise and get called, I'll be in a tough spot postflop\n- My stack isn't deep enough to make speculative plays like this profitable\n\nDecision: FOLD",

Their raise to 24 (3x BB) from early position suggests a strong hand.\n\n**Decision**: With Js 4d, I have:\n- Very weak hand that is easily dominated\n- No suited connectors\n- No potential for straight or flush\n- Even if I hit a Jack, I could be dominated by better Jacks\n- The opponent's raise suggests strength\n\nI should fold this hand. Calling 24 chips (3 BB) with J4 offsuit is a losing play long-term. I don't have the pot odds to justify calling, and I'm not getting good implied odds with this hand. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other tools I should use... I could look at my own hands to see patterns, but the decision seems clear.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- They raise from SB position (hand 42) - 3x raise to 24\n- They call preflop raises (hands 40, 43)\n- They seem to play relatively straightforward postflop with check/call patterns\n- They've shown aggression from SB before\n\nI have pocket Jacks (Jd Js) - this is a premium hand, especially with only one opponent left. I'm on the Button which is great position.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Blinds 4/8\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- I need to call 8 more\n- Minimum raise to 24 (which is 3x the big blind)\n- Stack: 158 chips (19.8 BB)\n\nWith pocket Jacks heads-up against SB's raise:\n1. Hand strength: Very strong heads-up, but vulnerable to overcards\n2. Position: Button - best position\n3. Stack: 19.8 BB - tournament stack, need to be careful but can play aggressively\n4. Opponent: Has raised from SB before (hand 42), seems capable of aggression\n\nI should definitely not fold. The question is call or raise.\n\nCalling pros:\n- See flop cheaply\n- Keep pot smaller if overcards come\n\nCalling cons:\n- Let opponent see flop cheaply with any two cards\n- Give them control\n- Miss value\n\nRaising pros:\n- Extract value from weaker hands\n- Define opponent's range\n- Take control of hand\n- Charge them to see overcards\n\nRaising cons:\n- If they have a monster (AA, KK, QQ), could lose big\n- Risk of getting 3-bet all-in\n\nGiven I have position and a strong hand, I should raise. A standard 3-bet would be to about 3x their raise, so around 48-50 chips. Let me calculate:\n- They raised to 16 (which is 2x the BB)\n- A 3x re-raise would be to 48 chips\n- This is about 30% of my stack, which is reasonable\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the raise sizing:\n- SB posted 4\n- They raised 16 (so total 16 to match)\n- The minimum raise to is 24, which means I need to make it 24 total to call\n- Wait, let me recalculate: They raised to 16, which means they put in 12 more than their SB (4+12=16)\n- To raise, minimum would be 16 + (16-4) = 28? No, the system says minimum raise to 24\n\nLet me think about this differently. The system says:\n- Amount to call: 8 (so I need to put in 8 more to match their 16)\n- Minimum raise to: 24\n\nSo if I raise to 24 total, that means I'm raising by 8 over their 16. That's a min-raise, which is weak.\n\nA better sizing would be 3x their raise: 16 * 3 = 48. Or maybe 2.5x: 40.\n\nGiven my stack is 158, raising to 48 (about 30% of stack) is reasonable. It builds the pot with my premium hand and extracts value.\n\nLet me make a standard 3-bet to 48 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6h 3c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. In any position, this is a fold preflop.\n\n2. **My position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is the worst position at the table (second to act preflop but first to act postflop).\n\n3. **My stack**: 178 chips (22.2 BB) - This is a decent stack size, but not so deep that I can afford to bleed chips.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Blinds: 4/8\n   - I've already posted 4 as SB\n   - BB posted 8\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 48\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - They've made several preflop raises: 8, 24, 16\n   - They seem to be an active player\n   - In hand 44, they raised to 16 then folded (possibly to a re-raise)\n   - They don't seem extremely tight or loose based on this limited sample\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 60 (4 + 8 + 48)\n   - I need to call 44 to see the flop\n   - Pot odds: 60:44 or ~1.36:1\n   - This is not great odds for a hand this weak\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have 22.2 BB which is a workable stack\n   - Calling here would commit 25% of my stack (44/178) with a terrible hand\n   - If I call and miss the flop (very likely with 6-3 offsuit), I'll be in a difficult position out of position\n   - This could easily become a -EV spot that bleeds my chips\n\n8. **Hand equity**: 6-3 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, I'm likely at best 30% equity, and probably much less against a typical raise.\n\nThe only argument for calling would be if I had a very specific read that GPT-OSS-120B is raising with complete garbage and I could outplay them postflop. But:\n- I don't have enough data to support this\n- Even if they are raising wide, 6-3 offsuit is still terrible\n- I'll be out of position which makes postflop play very difficult\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. With 6-3 offsuit in the SB facing a 6x BB raise, I should fold immediately. The hand is too weak, the position is bad, and the tournament cost is too high.\n\nI need to preserve my 22.2 BB stack for better spots. This is not a good spot to defend the blind or try to get creative.",

It's ahead of most ranges.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: \n   - SB seems to fold a lot but can make big calls (called 40 chips in hand 45)\n   - BB is extremely tight, folding 10 hands in a row preflop\n4. **Stack sizes**: Both opponents have similar stacks to mine (~22-23 BB)\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 22.2 BB, I have a comfortable stack. Pocket tens is strong enough to play for value here.\n\n\nA standard raise is the most strategic play. I'll raise to 24 chips, which is 3x the big blind, to build the pot with my strong pocket tens. This sizing puts pressure on opponents while remaining consistent with standard preflop raise sizes. The button position gives me maximum flexibility post-flop, and the raise will help define my opponents' hand ranges.",

I need to play very tight from this position.\n\n**Stack**: 190 chips (23.8 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament play. I need to be careful with my chips.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in SB: Has folded preflop in the last 10 hands consecutively! Very tight player.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in BB: Mixed playstyle - has called, raised, and folded. Showdowns show they've played some decent hands (Ks-Jc, Ac-Jh, Jd-Ad).\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to see a flop. The pot is 12 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. This is not enough to justify playing 2-3 offsuit.\n\n**Key considerations**:\n1. My hand is extremely weak - no pair, no suited cards, not connected (2 and 3 with different suits)\n2. I'm in the worst position (UTG) \n3. I have a short-ish stack that I need to preserve\n4. The SB player is very tight (folded 10 straight preflop hands)\n5. The BB player is more active and could defend their blind\n\nFrom UTG with 23.8 BB, I should only be playing premium hands. 2-3 offsuit is an instant fold. Even if the blinds are tight, I can't justify playing this hand. It's -EV in the long run.\n\nThe only argument for playing this would be if I was deep stacked and in late position with multiple limpers, but neither is true here.\n\nDecision: **FOLD**",

Tournament considerations (stack preservation vs. accumulation)"

It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 190 chips (23.8 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament poker. We're in the danger zone where we need to be careful.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 4/8 - So the big blind is 8 chips.\n\n5. **Pot**: 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8)\n\n6. **Action**: I need to call 8 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom the observation history, I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently from various positions (hands 40, 42, 43, 45)\n- GPT-OSS-120B also raises frequently and aggressively (hands 42, 44, 45)\n- Both players seem to be active and aggressive\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- I'm UTG with a marginal speculative hand (9-8 suited)\n- With 23.8 BB, I should be playing tighter, especially from early position\n- Suited connectors like 98s play better in late position or when I can see a cheap flop\n- From UTG, if I call 8 chips, I'm likely to face a raise from one of the aggressive players behind me\n- If I raise, I don't have enough fold equity with my stack size, and I'll be committed to the pot with a marginal hand\n\n**Decision**: Fold\n\n**Reasoning**:\n1. Poor position (UTG) - worst position at the table\n2. Marginal hand strength for UTG play - 98s is too weak to play from early position with a short stack\n3. Short stack (23.8 BB) - need to preserve chips for better spots\n4. Aggressive players behind me - high likelihood of facing a raise\n5. Tournament considerations - with a short stack, I need to be selective and look for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands\n\nThis is a clear fold. I should wait for a better hand or better position.",

They seem to have a narrow range.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nA\u26609\u2660 is a decent hand on the button:\n- Suited Ace with a decent kicker\n- Good stealing hand\n- Can make nut flushes\n- Position advantage\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Position**: I'm on the button, best position post-flop\n2. **Stack**: 22.2 BB - healthy stack, not desperate\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight BB, likely to fold to steal attempts\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds) - good for calling\n5. **Steal opportunity**: Since everyone folded, this is a good spot to steal blinds\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight, A9s is good enough to play from BTN\n- **Call**: Could call and see a flop, but might let BB see free flop\n- **Raise**: Good stealing spot. Should raise to pressure the tight BB\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature, a raise seems best. The minimum raise is 16 (2x BB), which is standard. I could also raise a bit more to 20-24 to really pressure them.\n\nLet me raise to 20 (2.5x BB) which is a solid steal size that should get folds from a tight player often enough to be profitable. If called, I have position and a decent hand.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise calculation: \n- Pot is 12 (4+8)\n- To raise, I need to make it at least 16 total (which is 2x the BB)\n- So raising to 16 would be the minimum\n- Raising to 20 or 24 would be more standard\n\nLet me go with 20 - it's a solid raise size that should fold out the tight BB often enough.",

My opponent has shown they can fold to pressure (check-folded in hand 45), but also capable of calling and raising with strong hands. Checking controls pot size, gives a free card to improve, and allows me to re-evaluate on the turn with position.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  I need to analyze the current situation and recall opponent information to make an informed decision.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN\n- Hand: As 9s (decent suited Ace)\n- Stack: 162 chips (20.2 BB)\n- Board: 5h 6s 6h\n- Pot: 40 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Board shows 5h 6s 6h - paired board with two hearts\n- I have As 9s - no pair, no flush draw (spades), no straight draw\n- My hand is essentially Ace-high on a paired board\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) actions:\n- Very tight preflop - lots of folds in hands 38-44\n- In hand 45: called 40 preflop, then check-folded on flop\n- In hand 49: raised preflop 24, bet 48 on flop, raised to 144 on flop, then checked turn and river\n- This suggests they can be aggressive with strong hands but also play passively when they miss\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 20.2 BB - a decent stack but not huge\n- The pot is 40 chips - already a decent size relative to stacks\n- I'm out of position (BTN vs BB) but actually have position advantage postflop\n\n**Decision:**\nThe flop is 5h 6s 6h. This is a paired board which is good for continuation betting as the preflop raiser. My opponent called preflop from the BB, which could mean:\n- They're defending their blind with a wide range\n- They could have pairs, suited connectors, broadways, or even Ace-high hands\n\nGiven that I was the preflop raiser and have position, I should make a continuation bet here. The paired board makes it less likely they connected strongly. My Ace-high might still be good, and I can represent having a 6 or an overpair.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that they called a 2.5x raise from the BB, so they have something. But with 20BB stacks and a 40 chip pot, checking is also reasonable to pot control with Ace-high.\n\nLet me think about sizing. The pot is 40, minimum raise is 12. A standard c-bet would be around 20-30 chips (50-75% pot).\n\nGiven my opponent's tendency to fold to pressure (as seen in hand 45 where they check-folded), and the fact that this is a paired board that hits my perceived range well, I should make a continuation bet. But I need to be careful with my stack size.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have Ace-high on a paired board. If I bet and get called or raised, I'll be in a tough spot. Checking gives me a free card to potentially hit an Ace or 9, and keeps the pot small with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven that I have position and can control the pot size, checking is probably the better play here. I can re-evaluate on the turn. If my opponent checks again, I might bet then as a delayed c-bet. If they bet, I can decide based on the size and my read.\n\nLet me go with check.",

Check - Take a free card, see the river\n2. Bet - Try to take down the pot now\n3. Raise - Not relevant since there's no bet to raise\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- I have position (on the button)\n- I have a decent but not strong hand\n- The opponent checked the flop, showing weakness\n- The turn card (Qh) could have helped:\n  - If opponent had a Q, they might have bet\n  - The heart could complete a flush draw\n  - The Q is an overcard to the board\n\n**Strategy:**\nThis is a good spot for a probe bet. The opponent showed weakness by checking the flop, and I can represent having a Q or better. A small bet could take down the pot. If I get called or raised, I can re-evaluate on the river.\n\nGiven I have position and the opponent has shown weakness, I should make a small value bet or bluff bet to try to win the pot now. Something like 15-20 chips (about 1/2 to 3/4 pot) would be appropriate.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The board is paired (6s), so trip 6s is possible. The Qh could be scary for both of us. The opponent checked the flop on a relatively dry board (except for the flush draw).\n\nActually, with As 9s, I have:\n- Overcard Ace\n- Backdoor flush draw (spades)\n- The board is paired\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the check on flop, I think a small bet here is good. But checking is also fine to see a free river card.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes. I have 20.2 BB, which is healthy. I don't need to take unnecessary risks. The pot is 40 chips, which is 5 BB. \n\nIf I check, I get a free card to hit my Ace or maybe improve in other ways.\nIf I bet, I risk chips but could win the pot immediately.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the fact they checked the flop, I think betting is better. I can represent the Q and get them to fold hands like pocket pairs, 5x, or small pairs.\n\nA bet of 20-25 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot) seems appropriate. This is about 2.5-3 BB.\n\nLet me go with a bet of 20 chips. This is a reasonable probe bet that gives me a chance to win the pot now.\n\nActually, wait. Looking at the legal actions again: \"fold, check, raise\". It says \"raise\" not \"bet\". But the minimum raise to is 12. This is confusing. Let me think about this...\n\nIf the amount to call is 0, and I can \"raise\" to 12, that means I can bet. In poker terminology,"

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #51 - PREFLOP**\n\n- **My Position**: BTN (Seat 1) - Button, which is the best position\n- **My Cards**: Qh 3d - Queen of hearts, 3 of diamonds. This is a very weak hand, not suited, not connected, low kicker.\n- **My Stack**: 202 chips (25.2 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament terms\n- **Blinds**: 4/8\n- **Pot**: 12 chips\n\n**Players at table**:\n- Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 202 chips (ME)\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 156 chips (SB)\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 188 chips (BB)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 249 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 193 chips (folded)\n\n**Actions this hand**:\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 4\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 8\n- preflop: Seat 4 fold\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold\n\n**Amount to call**: 8\n**Minimum raise to**: 16\n**Legal actions**: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n\nI used the recall_opponent_actions tool to gather information about both opponents:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB)**:\n- Hand 47: preflop fold\n- Hand 48: preflop fold\n- Hand 49: preflop raise to 24, then flop bet 48, flop raise to 144, turn check, river check - This suggests a very strong hand preflop that they were willing to go big with\n- Hand 50: preflop call 12, flop check, turn fold - This suggests they called a raise preflop but gave up on the turn\n- Showdowns: Kd 9d (hand 27), Tc Kc (hand 49)\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB)**:\n- Hands 40-47: preflop fold every time (8 consecutive folds)\n- Hand 48: preflop raise to 20\n- Hand 49: preflop fold\n- Hand 50: preflop fold\n- Showdowns: Qd 3d (hand 13), Ks Ah (hand 29)\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Qh 3d is extremely weak. Queen-high with a 3 kicker is not a hand I want to play, especially from the button when there are only two players left to act (SB and BB).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is minimized.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**:\n   - **SB (Seat 2)**: Seems to play relatively tight but can make big raises with strong hands (hand 49). They also called a raise preflop in hand 50 but folded on the turn. They seem capable of making moves.\n   - **BB (Seat 3)**: Very tight! They've folded 8 out of 9 hands preflop, only raising once. This suggests they're playing a very tight, conservative game. They're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 202 chips (25.2 BB)\n   - SB has 156 chips (19.5 BB)\n   - BB has 188 chips (23.5 BB)\n   - All stacks are relatively shallow, which means we should be more cautious with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 12. That's 1.5:1 odds, which requires me to win at least 40% of the time. With Q3o, I definitely don't have that equity against any reasonable range.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 25.2 BB, I'm in a decent position but not comfortable. I should be looking to preserve my stack or find good spots to accumulate chips. Q3o is not a good spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q3o is one of the weakest hands in poker, and even on the button, I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand against two opponents when I have no information that they're playing extremely loose. The BB is particularly tight, so if I call and they raise, I'll be in a tough spot. If I raise, I might get called by the SB or re-raised by the BB, and then I'll be building a pot with a hand that has very"

I shouldn't risk chips with weak hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: I should check if there's any relevant history, but from UTG with 45 offsuit, this is an easy fold regardless of opponent tendencies.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 chips. The pot is 12 chips, so 12:8 or 1.5:1 odds. Not good enough for this hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 25 BB, I need to preserve my stack.

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #53 - PREFLOP**\n- My Position: UTG (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 5c 2d (5 of clubs, 2 of diamonds)\n- My Stack: 202 chips (25.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Players at table: 5 players total\n- Amount to call: 8\n- Minimum raise to: 16\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nThis is a classic \"trash hand\" situation. 5c 2d is one of the worst starting hands in Texas Hold'em. It's unsuited, unconnected, and both cards are low.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 5c 2d is extremely weak. No pair potential, no straight potential (would need 3-4-6), no flush potential. This is a folding hand in virtually all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under The Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have to act first, and there are 4 players behind me who could wake up with strong hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 202 chips (25.2 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep. Tournament play requires careful stack preservation.\n\n4. **Opponents**: The search for observations on Seats 4 and 5 returned no results, so I have no specific reads on these opponents.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a 25 BB stack, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is definitely not the spot. I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have to call 8 to win 12, which is 1.5:1 odds. These odds are not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 5c 2d is unplayable from UTG position. I don't want to invest 8 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will almost never be profitable. Even if the blinds are weak players, the risk of running into a strong hand from one of the 4 players behind me is too high.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: I have a trash hand in early position with a decent stack size. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nLet me format the response correctly according to the required JSON format.",

Even though I can check for free, I should consider:\n1. My hand has very little potential - J4o is one of the worst hands in poker\n2. I'll be out of position postflop\n3. MiniMax has shown they can be aggressive postflop\n4. Even though I have pot odds to check, playing this hand will likely cost me chips postflop\n5. With a healthy but not huge stack of 24 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots\n\nThe only argument for checking is that it's free and the pot is 20 chips. But J4o is so weak that even hitting a J will often be problematic (kicker issues), and hitting a 4 isn't much better.

Let me analyze their patterns:\n\nFrom the data:\n- Hand 42: They bet 28 on flop, then checked turn and river\n- Hand 43: Raised preflop to 16, bet 16 on flop, then checked turn and river\n- Hand 49: Called preflop 24, then made a big raise to 96 on flop, called 48, then checked turn and river\n\nThey seem to be aggressive on flops when they have something, but then shut down on later streets. They also make big moves - like that raise to 96 chips on the flop in hand 49.\n\nNow let me look at the current situation:\n- I have Jc 4d - bottom pair with a weak kicker\n- Board: 2h 4h 3h - there's a flush draw and straight draw possible\n- I have 194 chips (24.2 BB)\n- Pot is 20 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 called preflop from MP position and is now facing me\n\nMy hand: I have a pair of 4s with J kicker. The board is very coordinated with 3 hearts (flush draw) and potential straight draws (A-5 makes a straight).\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's aggressive tendencies on flops (they bet or raise on flops in hands 42, 43, and 49), I should be cautious. My hand is vulnerable to:\n1. Any heart (flush)\n2. Any 5 (makes a straight)\n3. Any higher pair\n4. Any Ace (if they have A-h)\n\nI should check here. Betting with a marginal hand like this on a dangerous board against an aggressive opponent is not a good idea. Let me see what they do first. If they check back, I might consider a value bet on the turn if the board pairs or I improve.\n\nChecking is the standard play here with a marginal made hand on a dangerous board out of position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Jc 4d\n- My stack: 194 chips (24.2 BB)\n- Board: 2h 4h 3h 2s 8d\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) with 229 chips\n- Action: It's checked to me, I can check or bet\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a pair of 4s (Jc 4d)\n- Board shows: 2h 4h 3h 2s 8d\n- This is a very coordinated board with 3 hearts (flush possible), and a pair on board (2s)\n- Possible hands opponent could have:\n  - Flush (any heart)\n  - Full house (any 2)\n  - Straight (A-5 possible)\n  - Trips (any 8)\n  - Two pair\n  - Single pair\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have bottom pair (4s) with a Jack kicker\n- The board is very dangerous with multiple draws that have completed\n- Any heart beats me (flush)\n- Any 2 beats me (full house or trips)\n- Any 8 beats me (trips)\n- A-5 straight is possible\n- I'm likely beat by many hands\n\n**Opponent Tendency Analysis:**\nFrom the search results, MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 43: Raised preflop from UTG with Q9o, bet flop, checked turn/river - showed down Jd Ad (bluff or weak hand)\n- Hand 44: Folded preflop\n- Hand 45: Folded preflop\n- Hand 46: Folded preflop\n- Hand 48: Folded preflop\n- Hand 49: Called 24 preflop, called flop raise, checked down - showed down 6d Ts (weak hand)\n- Hand 50: Folded preflop\n- Hand 51: Folded preflop\n- Hand 52: Folded preflop\n- Hand 53: Folded preflop\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is very tight, folds a lot preflop. When they do play, they tend to be passive and show down weak hands. They've shown a tendency to check down when they have marginal hands.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 8 (limp/call)\n- Flop: Checked to them, they checked\n- Turn: Checked to them, they checked\n- River: Checked to me\n\nThis passive line suggests they have a weak or marginal hand. They would likely bet the river if they had a strong hand like a flush, full house, or trips.\n\n**My Decision:**\nI have bottom pair on a very dangerous board. However:\n1. The opponent has shown extreme passivity\n2. They've checked all three streets\n3. They would likely value bet any strong hand\n4. My hand might be good against their range\n\nBut the board is extremely dangerous. Any heart, any 2, any 8 beats me. That's a LOT of cards. Even though MiniMax-M2 is passive, checking down doesn't guarantee they have nothing. They could have:\n- A weak heart (like 5h, 6h, 7h, 9h, Th) that makes a low flush\n- A 2 (though unlikely given preflop call)\n- An 8\n- Or just complete air\n\nGiven:\n- The board is very coordinated and dangerous\n- I only have bottom pair\n- Opponent is passive but could still have a flush or trips\n- Pot is small (20 chips)\n- I have 24 BB stack\n\nThis is a clear check situation. I should not bet for value because:\n1. I don't get called by worse often enough\n2. I get called/raised by better frequently\n3. The risk/reward is poor\n\nI should check and hope to win at showdown with my bottom pair, or fold to any aggression.\n\n**Final Decision: CHECK**\n\nI want to see a cheap showdown. My hand is likely marginal at best, and betting would be risky. The opponent's passivity suggests they might have nothing, but the board is too dangerous to value bet.",

Even in position, this hand is:\n- Not connected (7-card gap)\n- Not suited\n- No high card value\n- Very unlikely to make strong hands\n\nThe pot is only 12 chips and I need to call 4 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is decent, but with this hand, even those odds aren't enough. This hand has very little potential to win a showdown.\n\nTournament considerations: While 26 BB is a decent stack, it's not deep enough to be making speculative calls with trash hands. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold this garbage hand and wait for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 9d Kc (King-nine offsuit)\n**Position:** CO (Cutoff) - good position\n**My stack:** 210 chips (26.2 BB) - healthy stack\n**Situation:** \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24 (3x the big blind)\n- I need to call 24 to see the flop\n- Pot is currently 36 (4+8+24)\n\n**Opponent analysis:** \nLooking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- They've been very tight preflop, folding 9 out of 10 recent hands\n- The only time they didn't fold preflop was in the data shown\n- Their showdowns show they've played hands like K-J, K-9, J-J, T-9\n\nThis is a very tight player who just made a 3x raise. When a tight player raises, they typically have a strong range: high pocket pairs (AA-QQ), AK, AQ, AJ, maybe KQ.\n\n**Hand evaluation:**\nK9o is a marginal hand at best. It's dominated by:\n- All better kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT)\n- All pocket pairs 99+\n- Even against a hand like AQ, we're only about 45% equity\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 24 to win 36, which is 24/(24+36) = 40% equity needed to break even.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the cutoff which is good position, but there are still players behind me (Seats 2, 3, 4) who could 3-bet or call.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 26.2 BB, which is a decent stack in a tournament. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is important.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAgainst a tight player who has been folding almost everything, this raise represents real strength. K9o is too weak to call here. Even with position, I'm likely dominated or flipping at best. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

This is a marginal hand at best.\n2. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB), which is a disadvantage.\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 called preflop. Looking at their history:\n   - They tend to call preflop with marginal hands (called 8 and 16 chips)\n   - They check-folded on the flop in hand 57 after calling 16 preflop\n   - They play passively post-flop (lots of checking)\n   - They haven't shown any aggression in the recalled hands\n\n4. **Board texture:** The board is somewhat coordinated with:\n   - Two clubs (flush draw possible)\n   - Straight draws (2-4, 4-7)\n   - I have a 6, which gives me bottom pair\n\n5. **Pot odds:** The pot is 20 chips and I can check for free. Checking is essentially 0 risk.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack (25.2 BB) and don't need to take unnecessary risks with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** Given that:\n- I have bottom pair with a weak kicker\n- The board is coordinated with potential draws\n- I'm out of position\n- My opponent plays passively\n- I can see the turn for free\n\nI should **check**. Betting here would be a bluff or semi-bluff, but with bottom pair and a weak kicker, I don't have much fold equity. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 6s 9c - I have bottom pair (6s) on a board of 5c 3c 6d\n**Position:** BB (out of position)\n**Stack:** 202 chips (25.2 BB) - healthy stack\n**Board:** 5c 3c 6d - Rainbow board with some straight draws (2-4, 4-7)\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 bet 8 chips on the flop\n- I need to call 8 to see the turn\n- Minimum raise to 16\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2 in seat 4):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 57: Called preflop 16, checked flop, then folded to a bet\n- Hand 54: Called preflop 8, checked flop, turn, river (showed down Ac 7d on 2h 4h 3h 2s 8d - they had Ace high on a scary board)\n- Hand 49: Called 24 preflop, raised to 96 on flop, then called 48, checked turn and river (showed 6d Ts on Td Qs Qd Qh 5d - they had trips)\n- Generally seems to call preflop with a wide range but plays passively postflop unless they have strong hands\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have bottom pair with a 9 kicker\n- The board is relatively dry (rainbow, no high cards)\n- There are straight draws: A-2-4, 2-4-7, 4-7-8\n- I could be ahead of many hands like Ace-high, King-high, straight draws\n- But vulnerable to any overpair, any 5 or 3, or higher pairs\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 28, I need to call 8\n- Getting 3.5:1 on my call\n- This is good pot odds\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Weak made hand (bottom pair). Could be best but vulnerable.\n2. **Position:** Out of position, which is bad\n3. **Opponent:** Seems to be betting small (8 into 28). This could be a probe bet, value bet with a 5 or 3, or a bluff/semi-bluff.\n4. **Stack preservation:** With 25 BB, I don't want to get into a big pot with such a weak hand\n5. **Pot odds:** Good immediate pot odds, but implied odds are questionable out of position\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too weak given the pot odds and opponent's small bet\n- **Call:** Could be reasonable given pot odds, but out of position with a weak hand is problematic\n- **Raise:** Could raise to protect my hand and get better hands to fold, but what worse hands call? Also risks building a big pot with a marginal hand\n\nGiven that the opponent's bet is small (less than 1/3 pot), and I have a made hand (even if weak), and I'm getting good pot odds, calling seems reasonable. However, I need to be prepared to fold on many turn cards if they continue betting.\n\nI think calling is the best option here. It's a small investment relative to the pot, and I could be ahead of many hands. If they continue aggressive action on the turn, I can re-evaluate.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With bottom pair and a weak kicker, out of position, even though the bet is small, I'm not thrilled about calling. The opponent could have:\n- A 5 or 3 (ahead of me)\n- A better 6 (ahead of me)\n- A pocket pair (ahead of me)\n- A straight draw (behind me but has equity)\n- Two overcards (behind me but has 6 outs)\n\nGiven my stack size of 25 BB, I should be more conservative. The problem with calling is that I'll face difficult decisions on the turn and river out of position. I don't want to bleed chips with a marginal hand.\n\nI think folding is actually the better play here. Preserve my stack for better spots. The small bet size is inviting, but I need to think about future streets and my positional disadvantage.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s 8h - This is a suited connector (suited one-gapper actually). It's a decent speculative hand in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 198 chips (24.8 BB), which is a healthy but not huge stack.\n\n4. **Current situation**: Everyone has folded to me except the BB (Seat 2). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the opponent's history:\n   - They seem to play a relatively tight game\n   - They've folded preflop in several recent hands (hands 53, 54, 56, 59)\n   - When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 49, 52, 58) and sometimes call (hands 50, 51, 57)\n   - Their raises are typically 24 chips (3x BB), which is standard\n   - In hand 49, they showed down Kc Tc on a board that gave them trips, suggesting they can play strong hands aggressively\n   - In hand 57, they called a 24 chip raise preflop and then called 50 on the flop before folding on the turn\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win a pot of 12 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is very good for a speculative hand like 78s.\n\n7. **Implied odds**: Since I'm in position and the opponent has shown willingness to call bets postflop (like in hand 57 where they called 50 on the flop), there are good implied odds if I hit a strong hand.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 24.8 BB, I can afford to take a speculative flop here. The risk is minimal (4 chips) and the potential reward is good.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear call. I have:\n- Good position (BTN)\n- A playable speculative hand (78s)\n- Great pot odds (3:1)\n- Good implied odds against an opponent who plays postflop\n- Minimal risk to my stack\n\nI'll call the 4 chips and see the flop in position.",

I can act last.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Pot is 16 chips, I can check for free right now.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak pair + straight draw. Not strong, but has potential\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on button)\n3. **Opponent**: Seems somewhat tight, checked to me\n4. **Stack size**: Healthy at 24.2 BB\n5. **Pot size**: Small at 16 chips\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: See a free turn card, no risk\n- **Raise**: Try to take it down now or charge opponent to draw\n\nGiven that I have some equity (pair + straight draw) and I'm in position, checking seems reasonable to see the turn card for free. However, I could also consider a small value bet with my pair + draw.\n\nBut wait - the opponent checked to me. They could have:\n- Nothing (air)\n- A better pair (9s, Ts, Js, etc.)\n- A higher pair\n- A straight draw\n- Two overcards\n\nWith my weak pair and straight draw, I think checking is the best option. I want to see the turn card for free and re-evaluate. If I bet and get raised, I'd have a tough decision. If I bet and get called, I'm not sure where I stand.\n\nChecking allows me to:\n1. See a free turn card\n2. Potentially improve to two pair, trips, or a straight\n3. Keep the pot small with my marginal hand\n4. Use my positional advantage later\n\nI don't think I need to bet here for \"protection\" since the board is relatively safe and my hand isn't strong enough to value bet.\n\nLet me check.",

The Ah is concerning.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position\n3. **Opponent**: Based on history, opponent can be aggressive but has been folding a lot recently. They checked twice, suggesting weakness.\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 16, I can check for free\n5. **Tournament**: I'm at 24.2 BB, which is healthy but not deep\n\n**What should I do?**\n- Checking seems weak - I have some showdown value\n- Betting could take down the pot now, but what if I get raised?\n- The Ah is scary - opponent could have Ax\n- However, they checked the flop with an 8 on board and now checked the turn with an Ace\n\nGiven that:\n- Opponent has shown weakness by checking twice\n- I have some showdown value with middle pair\n- I could try a small value bet to extract value from worse hands or take the pot\n- But betting risks getting raised and having to fold\n\nI think checking is the safest play here. I have a marginal hand, the board is getting scary with the Ace, and I can see a free river card. If I bet and get raised, I'll likely have to fold. Checking allows me to realize my equity and potentially get to showdown cheaply.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, with middle pair on a board with an Ace, and an opponent who has shown they can be aggressive, checking is definitely the right play. I don't want to build a big pot with a marginal hand, and checking keeps the pot small.\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about this differently. I have a pair of 8s. The opponent has checked twice. This could mean:\n1. They have nothing and are giving up\n2. They have a weak hand and are scared of the Ace\n3. They have a monster and are trapping (less likely given they checked flop too)\n\nIf I bet small, like 8-12 chips:\n- I might get called by worse hands (6x, 3x, pocket pairs below 8)\n- I might get folds from complete air\n- If I get raised, I can fold\n\nBut given the Ace on board and my marginal hand, I think the conservative play is to check. I have showdown value and don't need to inflate the pot.\n\nFinal decision: Check.",

The opponent's bet suggests strength, and there are too many hands that beat me. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, I don't have enough equity to call here with just bottom pair.\n\nThe pot odds of 3.33:1 would require me to win about 30% of the time. Given the board texture and opponent's betting pattern, I don't think I have that much equity.\n\n**Recommendation: Fold**",

Has folded preflop in last 9 hands (52-60)\n- Only showed down with weak hands like Q3s and KA\n- Very conservative player\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is a decent hand, especially on the button\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent position post-flop\n3. **Stack sizes**: All stacks are relatively short (12.1 BB, 7.4 BB, 10.5 BB)\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents appear tight, especially the BB who has folded 9 straight hands\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 12.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. This is a decent spot.\n\n**Decision options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight, K9o on button is playable\n- **Call**: Could be okay, but with these short stacks and tight opponents, I could also consider raising\n- **Raise**: Good option to steal blinds. Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB), which puts pressure on short stacks\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button with a decent hand\n- Both opponents are short-stacked and tight\n- The BB has folded 9 straight hands preflop\n- I need to accumulate chips with 12.1 BB\n\nI think raising to steal the blinds is the best play. A standard raise to 32 (2 BB) risks 32 to win 24, which is good. Even if called, I have position and a decent hand.\n\nLet me raise to 32 chips.",

It's not strong enough to call a big raise with a short stack.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I have 162 chips (10.1 BB). This is a relatively short stack in a tournament. Calling 136 chips would leave me with only 26 chips (1.6 BB), which is extremely short.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 208 chips and I need to call 136 chips. That's about 1.5:1 pot odds. K9 offsuit against a likely range from the BB who is re-raising after I min-raised is not good enough.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has 16 chips and is in the BB. They posted 16 and now are raising to 168. Since they only have 16 chips, they must be all-in. Wait, let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the stacks again:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 16 chips\n- They posted BB of 16\n- I raised to 32\n- They raised to 168\n\nSince Seat 3 only has 16 chips, they cannot raise to 168. This must mean the \"16 chips\" is their stack AFTER posting the BB. So they started with 32 chips, posted BB of 16, and are now raising all-in for 16 more (total 32).\n\nBut the amount to call is 136, which means the raise is to 168 total (32 + 136). This is confusing.\n\nLet me recalculate: If I raised to 32, and the amount to call is 136, then the total bet is 168 (32 + 136 = 168). Since Seat 3 shows as having 16 chips, I think the hand history is showing that Seat 3 started with 184 chips (16 + 168), posted BB of 16, leaving 168, and then raised all-in for 168.\n\nSo the situation is:\n- Pot: 208 chips\n- I need to call 136 chips\n- If I call, I'll have 26 chips left\n- I'm facing an all-in raise from the BB\n\nWith K9 offsuit and a stack of 10.1 BB, I should fold here. The hand is not strong enough to call off most of my stack. I should preserve my 162 chips (10.1 BB) for a better spot. K9 offsuit is dominated by many hands that would make this play (any Ace, any King with better kicker, any pair, etc.).\n\nThe math: I need to call 136 to win 208 + 136 = 344 chips. That's about 2.5:1 pot odds. But with K9 offsuit, I likely have less than 40% equity against the BB's range, making this a -EV call.\n\nI should fold and keep my 10.1 BB stack for a better opportunity.",

This is a marginal hand, especially in CO position.\n\n2. **My stack**: 162 chips (10.1 BB) - This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n3. **The action**: \n   - SB posted 8\n   - BB posted 16\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 283 (which is effectively all-in since they have 0 chips left)\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 283 to win 307 (the pot). That's about 1.08:1 pot odds, which is terrible.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight - mostly folding preflop with occasional small raises. This large raise (283) from a player who is now at 0 chips suggests they went all-in. This is likely a strong hand.\n\n6. **My situation**: \n   - I have 162 chips, so calling 283 would mean going all-in for 162\n   - The pot is 307, so if I call 162, the pot would be 469\n   - My pot odds would be 162/469 = about 34.5% equity needed\n   - With A7o, I'm unlikely to have that much equity against a likely strong range\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 10.1 BB, I should be looking for better spots. A7o is not a strong enough hand to call an all-in, especially against what appears to be a tight player making a large all-in raise.\n\nThe decision is clear: I should fold. A7o is too weak to call an all-in here, and I need to preserve my 10.1 BB stack for better opportunities.",

Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand (#63) - PREFLOP:**\n- **Position:** UTG (Under the Gun, Seat 1) - this is the worst position\n- **Hole Cards:** 3c 8s (3 of clubs, 8 of spades) - This is a terrible hand, offsuit and low\n- **Stack:** 162 chips (10.1 BB) - This is a short stack\n- **Blinds:** 8/16\n- **Pot:** 24 chips\n- **Amount to call:** 16 chips\n- **Minimum raise:** 32 chips\n- **Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\n**Players at table:**\n- Seat 1: Kimi-K2 (me) - 162 chips\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 118 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 216 chips\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 189 chips\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 291 chips\n\n**My recent hand history analysis:**\nLooking at the last 10 hands played:\n- Hand 62: CO position, folded As 7d preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 61: BTN position, raised to 32 with Ks 9d, then folded (likely to a re-raise)\n- Hand 60: SB position, called with 7s 8h, then folded on turn\n- Hand 59: BB position, checked with 6s 9c, folded on flop\n- Hand 58: UTG position, folded 7d 2d preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 57: CO position, folded 9d Kc preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 56: BTN position, folded Kc 7c preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 55: SB position, folded 2h 9d preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 54: BB position, checked Jc 4d, won 20 chips\n- Hand 53: UTG position, folded 5c 2d preflop (good fold)\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. I've been playing very tight, folding most hands preflop\n2. My stack is critically short at 10.1 BB\n3. I'm in the worst position (UTG)\n4. My hand is 3c 8s - absolutely terrible, one of the worst starting hands in poker\n5. I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- With 10.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory, but this is NOT a pushing hand\n- From UTG, I should only play premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe AQ)\n- 3c 8s has no equity, no playability, and is dominated by virtually any calling range\n- Even if I could steal the blinds, it's not worth risking 10% of my stack with this garbage\n- The table hasn't seen me show down many hands, so I have a tight image, but that doesn't justify playing this hand\n\n**Decision:** FOLD\n\nThis is a trivial fold. I need to preserve my short stack for a better opportunity. With 10.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, and 3c 8s UTG is a clear fold. I should wait for a better hand or better position (ideally both) before committing chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 4d Qc (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 146 chips (9.1 BB) - Short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 40 chips\n\n**Action so far:**\n- SB posted 8\n- I posted BB 16\n- Seat 2 folded\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Minimum raise: 32\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Q4 offsuit is a very weak hand, definitely in the bottom 20% of starting hands\n- No suitedness, no connectedness\n- From BB, I get to see a free flop\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's preflop actions from the recall:\n- Very tight player - folds most hands\n- When they do enter pots, they typically just call (limp)\n- In hand 54: called preflop, then checked down\n- In hand 57: called preflop, checked flop, then folded to action\n- In hand 59: called preflop, then led out with a small bet on flop\n\nThis player is passive and tight. When they limp in, they likely have marginal to decent hands but are not strong enough to raise.\n\n**My situation:**\n- I'm short stacked at 9.1 BB\n- I have a terrible hand (Q4o)\n- I can check and see a free flop\n- If I raise, I'd be risking 32 chips (22% of my stack) with a terrible hand\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. There's no reason to invest more chips with Q4o. Even though I'm short stacked, I should preserve my chips for better spots. The pot is already 40 chips, which is decent relative to my stack, but I have no hand equity to speak of.\n\nChecking is free and gives me a chance to hit something (though unlikely). If I hit a Q on the flop, I might be able to get value from MiniMax-M2's weak range. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nRaising would be spewing chips with a terrible hand. Even if MiniMax-M2 is tight, they could easily have a better hand than Q4o, and I'm risking 22% of my stack.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free flop.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q4o is a very weak hand with no potential.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at MiniMax-M2's history, I can see they have been very tight - folding preflop most of the time (15 out of 20 actions), and when they do call, they seem passive postflop (check-fold pattern in hand 57). In hand 59, they called preflop and then bet 8 on the flop.\n\nNow let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 4d Qc - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack to make Q-J-10-9-8? No, wait... let me recalculate)\n- Board: Ac 2d Kd - There's an Ace and King on board\n- Actually, I don't have much. I have Q high, which is weak on this board. The only draw I might have is if I have a diamond (4d) for a flush draw, but I need two more diamonds. Board has one diamond (2d).\n\nLet me reconsider: I have 4d Qc. Board is Ac 2d Kd.\n- I have ONE diamond (4d) but would need two more diamonds for a flush\n- I have no pair, no straight draw really (would need J-10 for Q-J-10 straight but board is A-K-2)\n- I basically have Q-high with a backdoor flush draw\n\n**Situation:**\n- I'm in BB, heads up against MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4\n- MiniMax-M2 called preflop from what position? They called from Seat 4, which is MP (middle position)\n- They called 16 preflop, which is a standard call\n- I checked preflop (as BB)\n- Now it's checked to me on the flop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- MiniMax-M2 is very tight, folding preflop 75% of the time\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (check-fold pattern)\n- They have shown some aggression in hand 59 with a small flop bet\n\n\n- The pot is modest at 40 chips, and I'm facing a low-risk decision\n- With no bets to call, checking seems the most prudent move\n- My hand lacks significant strength or drawing potential\n- I'll preserve my stack and see if any favorable cards develop on the turn\n\nThe optimal play is to check and cautiously evaluate the next street.",

A bluff might work but it's too risky with this stack size and such a weak hand. The opponent's passivity suggests they might also have a weak hand and be willing to check it down.",

I need to be careful about preserving my chips.\n\n**Action**: Only the BB (Seat 2) remains, everyone else folded.\n\n**Opponent data**: Looking at Seat 2's actions, they have:\n- Folded preflop frequently (hands 53, 54, 56, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64)\n- Called preflop occasionally (hands 51, 57)\n- Raised preflop a few times (hands 52, 58)\n- When they do play, they seem to be somewhat aggressive postflop (bets on turn in hands 51, 60)\n\nThe opponent in the BB seems to be fairly tight, folding most of the time preflop. However, my hand 6c 8d is extremely weak. Even though I'm getting good odds (calling 8 to win 24, or 3:1), this hand has very poor equity against any reasonable BB defending range.\n\nWith 11.1 BB, I should be looking for much better spots to risk my chips. Even though I only need to call 8 chips to see a flop, if I hit something marginal, I could lose more chips postflop. And if I miss (which will happen most of the time), I just threw away 8 chips that represent 1% of my stack.\n\nThe only consideration is that the BB folds a lot preflop, so I could potentially raise and steal. But:\n1. A minimum raise to 32 would risk 32 chips (2 BB) to win 24\n2. With 11.1 BB, I can't afford to make many such attempts\n3. If called, I have a terrible hand with poor playability\n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand/spot.",

It's not a premium hand, but it has some potential because:\n- Suited (can make flush)\n- Connected (can make straight)\n- Both cards are low\n\nHowever, this is a tournament situation with 11.1 BB. This is actually a short stack situation where I need to be careful.\n\nLooking at Seat 5's tendencies:\nFrom the data I retrieved, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in 16 out of 20 recent hands\n- Only raised twice: once for 24 (which could have been a steal) and once for 283 (which was likely a premium hand)\n- When they did raise in hand 57, they continued betting on flop and turn aggressively\n\nThis suggests Seat 5 is a tight player who raises with strong hands. A 3x raise from them likely means they have a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, etc.).\n\nWith 5-7 suited and 11.1 BB:\n- I don't have the odds to call with this speculative hand\n- If I call 48, I'll have 130 chips left (8.1 BB)\n- If I miss the flop (which is likely), I'll be in a tough spot\n- I could consider shoving as a semi-bluff, but with 11.1 BB, that's a big risk with a weak hand\n \nI need to preserve my tournament stack. With 11.1 BB, I'm in a critical position where I can't afford to waste chips on marginal hands. The tight raiser's range suggests I'm unlikely to win, and calling would significantly reduce my stack without a strong chance of success. Folding is the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life.",

Let me analyze:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Kh - This is a very weak hand, offsuit with a low kicker\n2. **My position**: SB - Worst position postflop\n3. **My stack**: 154 chips (9.6 BB) - Short stack, in danger zone\n4. **Action**: There's been a raise to 48, then a re-raise to 100, then another re-raise to 211\n5. **Amount to call**: 203 chips - This would commit almost my entire stack (leaving me with just 51 chips)\n6. **Legal actions**: Only fold or call (no raising allowed)\n\nLooking at the opponent actions history:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been relatively active with raises (hands 67, 69)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has made some raises but also folded to pressure\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) made a big raise to 211, which is essentially an all-in (they have 0 chips now, so they were all-in)\n\nThe action shows:\n- Seat 3 raises to 48 (3x BB)\n- Seat 4 re-raises to 100 (committing most of their short stack)\n- Seat 5 re-raises all-in to 211\n\nThis is a massive multi-way pot with very strong action. The all-in from Seat 5 suggests a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK). Seat 4's 3-bet to 100 also suggests strength. Seat 3's initial raise could be wider but still strong.\n\nWith Kh3d in the SB:\n- No suitedness\n- Very weak kicker\n- Dominated by any other King\n- No straight or flush potential\n\nCalling 203 chips would leave me with only 51 chips (3.2 BB). This is a terrible spot with a terrible hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. Even with a short stack, this hand has terrible equity against the range of hands that are showing this much strength. I need to preserve my remaining 154 chips for a better spot - ideally when I can be the aggressor or at least have a hand with some showdown value.\n\nThe pot is already 383 and it's 203 to call, so I'm getting less than 2:1 odds. Even if I somehow won, I'd only gain 180 chips net (383-203), which isn't enough to justify the risk with this hand. I need to wait for a much better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: 8d 6h (unsuited, low connectors)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- My stack: 154 chips (9.6 BB) - Short stacked\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 chips (1 BB)\n- To call ratio: 16/154 = ~10.4% of my stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Kimi-K2 (SB): Very tight, has folded preflop in 7 of last 9 hands. Only showed aggression once with a big raise.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Short stack (37 chips), very aggressive with multiple preflop raises. Has gone all-in or close to it several times. Seems to be in \"push/fold\" mode with a short stack.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n8-6 offsuit is a weak hand. It's not connected (gap), unsuited, and low. This hand has very poor showdown value and poor postflop playability.\n\n**Position:** Being on the button is good, but with a short stack and weak hand, this doesn't help much.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. This is terrible for 8-6 offsuit.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 9.6 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory myself. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands. Calling here would commit ~10% of my stack with a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent-specific considerations:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB is short (37 chips = 2.3 BB) and aggressive. If I call, they might shove, putting me in a tough spot.\n- Kimi-K2 in SB is tight and might fold or just complete.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 8-6 offsuit is too weak to call 1 BB with a short stack, especially when the BB is a short-stacked aggressive player who could shove on me. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nHowever, I could consider a raise. With 9.6 BB, I could shove all-in. Let me think about that:\n- If I shove 154 into a pot of 24, that's a big overbet.\n- The BB only has 37 chips, so they might call with a wide range.\n- The SB is tight and would likely fold without a strong hand.\n- With 8-6 offsuit, my equity against a random calling range from the short stack would be poor.\n\nShoving with 8-6 offsuit is a bad idea. It's a clear fold.\n\nLet me double-check: The pot is 24 (8 from SB + 16 from BB). I need to call 16. That's 40% of the pot. With 8-6 offsuit, my equity is likely 30-35% at best against random hands, and much worse against any reasonable calling range. This is -EV.\n\nFold is the correct play.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN\n- My cards: 8d Js (offsuit, mediocre hand)\n- My stack: 146 chips (9.1 BB)\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Amount to call: 8 (I'm SB, posted 8 already, need 8 more to complete)\n- Minimum raise: 32\n\n**Opponent information (Seat 2 - BB):**\nFrom the opponent actions, I can see:\n- They have been folding a lot preflop (hands 64, 66, 68, 69, 70)\n- They raised big in hand 67 (118), hand 71 (166), and hand 72 (40 then called)\n- In hand 27 and 49 showdowns, they showed Kd9d and TcKc - reasonable hands\n- In hand 71 showdown, they showed AhKd - premium hand\n\n**My recent play:**\n- I've been folding a lot (59 folds out of 72 hands)\n- My win rate is low (18%)\n- In hand 71, I folded 8d6h on BTN\n- In hand 66, I folded 7h4c on BTN\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 8d Js is a weak offsuit hand. Not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN which is good position, but with only one opponent (BB) left to act.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 146 chips (9.1 BB) is getting short. I need to be selective but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: The BB seems to be playing tight-aggressive. They fold a lot but when they raise, they raise big. This suggests they're not defending their BB lightly.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. That's decent odds, but with such a weak hand, it's not enough.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 9.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I shouldn't be calling raises with marginal hands. I should either fold or raise (steal).\n\n**Decision**: \n- I could try to steal with a raise since opponent folds a lot\n- However, 8d Js is very weak and if called, I'm in bad shape\n- With my stack size, I should be more selective\n- The opponent has shown they can raise big when they play, so a steal attempt risks a big re-raise\n- Folding is the safest and most correct play here\n\nLet me fold this hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 7h 5s is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but not enough to compensate for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 146 chips, which is 9.1 BB. This is a short stack in tournament play. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not playing marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent information**: I checked MiniMax-M2's recent actions. They seem to be raising frequently preflop (hands 68, 70, 72) but also folding sometimes. In hand 70, they raised to 100 and then called 73 more, suggesting they had a strong hand. In hand 72, they raised to 80 and then bet 120 on the flop, showing aggression.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 9.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should only be playing premium hands or good stealing opportunities. 75o is not a hand I should be playing, even on the button. I need to preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe correct decision here is to fold. I have a terrible hand, a short stack, and no reason to invest 16 chips (1 BB) in this spot. I should wait for a better hand or a better stealing opportunity.",

Looking at their recent actions:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 74)\n- When they do raise, they tend to raise big (118, 166, 40, and now 48)\n- They went to showdown with strong hands like AK, KT, K9\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is playing relatively tight and when they raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nHand strength:\n- K6o is a weak hand, dominated by many hands that would raise\n- We're out of position\n- No suitedness, no connectivity\n\nStack considerations:\n- I have 130 chips (8.1 BB)\n- Calling would cost me 32 chips (25% of my stack)\n- If I call and miss the flop, I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- This is a tournament, so preserving my stack is important\n\nPot odds:\n- Need to call 32 to win 72\n- Getting about 2.25:1 odds\n- With K6o, this is not enough even if opponent is raising wide\n\nGiven that Seat 2 seems to be a tight player who raises with strong hands, and I have a weak hand out of position with a short stack, this is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8h 6h - suited connector, but not very strong. In SB with only 7.6 BB left, this is a short stack situation.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position post-flop)\n\n3. **Stack size**: 122 chips (7.6 BB) - very short stacked\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 32 from MP (seat 4). This is a 2x raise over the BB.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56 (24/56 = 43% equity needed)\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently - 8 raises in various situations. They seem aggressive, raising anywhere from 2x to 6x+ the BB. They raised to 32 in hand #68, to 100 in hand #70, and to 80 in hand #72. This shows they vary their raise sizes.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 7.6 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n**Analysis of 86s from SB**:\n- This is a marginal hand, especially out of position\n- As a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- From SB, I need to be very careful as I'll be out of position post-flop\n- The pot odds aren't great (need 43% equity)\n- 86s typically has around 35-40% equity against typical raising ranges\n\n**Decision**: Given my short stack (7.6 BB), being out of position, and having a marginal hand, I should fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots where I can shove with fold equity. From SB with this stack size, I should only be calling/raising with premium hands or shoving all-in to maximize fold equity.\n\nIf I call 24, I'll have 98 chips left (6.1 BB) and be out of position post-flop with a weak drawing hand. This is not a profitable situation.\n\nI should wait for a better spot - ideally when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand where I can shove all-in preflop.",

This is a short stack but not yet desperate.\n\n4. **Situation**: \n   - Blinds: 8/16\n   - Pot: 56 chips\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 32\n   - I need to call 24 to see the flop\n   - Minimum raise to 48 (if I were to shove, I'd raise to 122)\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Hand 71: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 72: Preflop raise to 80, then flop bet 120 (very aggressive)\n   - Hand 73: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 75: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 76: Preflop raise to 32, then fold (likely to a re-raise)\n   - Hand 77: Preflop check (limp), then flop fold\n   - Hand 78: Preflop fold\n\n   MiniMax-M2 appears to be playing relatively tight but makes occasional raises. When they do raise preflop, they often follow up with aggression post-flop.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56, which is 42.9% pot odds. This would require me to win at least 42.9% of the time to break even.\n\n7. **Hand Equity**: Td 2c has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, T2o only has about 40% equity. Against a typical raising range, it's likely 30% or less.\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I'm short-stacked at 7.6 BB\n   - I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n   - T2o from SB is one of the worst possible situations\n   - Even if I hit the flop (unlikely), I'll be out of position\n\n9. **Fold Equity**: If I shove all-in for 122 chips, I might have some fold equity, but MiniMax-M2 has shown they can call or raise preflop and then fold to pressure. However, risking 122 chips with T2o is terrible.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm out of position, I'm short-stacked, and the opponent has shown they can be aggressive post-flop which would put me in difficult spots. I should wait for a much better situation to risk my tournament life.",

I have:\n1. A decent hand with an Ace\n2. Fold equity against both opponents\n3. Position advantage\n4. Critical stack size that needs action\n\nThe minimum raise is 32, but with my stack size, I should go all-in for 122 chips. This puts maximum pressure on both opponents and gives me fold equity, which I need with a marginal hand like A9o.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qc 4h - This is a very weak hand. Q4 offsuit is a fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **My position**: BB (Big Blind) - Already invested 32 chips.\n\n3. **My stack**: 114 chips (3.6 BB) - I'm extremely short-stacked.\n\n4. **Current situation**:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 203 (all-in)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 187\n   - I need to call 171 to see the flop\n   - Pot is 438 chips\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: This player has been raising preflop (hands 75, 76) and folding many hands. The showdown history shows they had strong hands when they went to showdown (Kd9d, TcKc, AhKd). This suggests they raise with decent hands. Their all-in raise to 203 is significant.\n   \n   - **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: This player has been more selective. They've shown strong hands at showdown (AcAs, AdAc). They called the all-in, which suggests they have a strong hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 171 to win 438 chips. That's about 2.56:1 pot odds. This means I need ~28% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand strength**: Q4 offsuit has very poor equity against typical raising ranges. Against two opponents who have already shown significant strength (one all-in, one call), my Q4 is almost certainly dominated.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With only 3.6 BB left, I need to be very selective. While I'm getting short and need to make a move soon, Q4 offsuit is not the hand to do it with, especially against two opponents who have already committed significant chips.\n\n9. **My action options**: I can only fold or call (no raising option shown).\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q4 offsuit is a terrible hand to call off my tournament life with, especially against two opponents showing strength. Even though I'm short-stacked, I should wait for a better spot. The pot odds are not good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and preserve my 82 remaining chips (114-32) for a better opportunity.",

The board is K-high, so my queen is essentially worthless here.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the opponent actions I retrieved:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive preflop with multiple raises\n- They called a 187 chip bet in hand #81 (recent)\n- They've shown down strong hands: AA twice, 77, Ac7d\n- They seem to play premium hands strongly\n- On the flop in hand #72, they bet 120 after raising preflop\n- In hand #77, they checked then folded on flop\n\n**Tournament situation:**\nI'm extremely short-stacked with only 2.6 BB.

There's no value in betting here:\n- I can't get a better hand to fold\n- I have no equity if called\n- I preserve my tiny stack for a better spot\n- I get to see a free card\n\nIf I had any draw or pair, I might consider a check-raise all-in as a semi-bluff, but with Q-high on a K-high board, this is a clear check/fold situation.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With Q-high on a K-high coordinated board, I have no hand equity and no fold equity against the big stack.

The current bet of 32 into a 96 pot is a small bet (1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 96\n- To call: 32\n- Pot odds: 128:32 or 4:1\n- I need 20% equity to break even on a call\n\n**My Equity:**\nWith Q-high on a K-7-10 board, I likely have very low equity. Even against a complete bluff, my queen high might not be good. I have no draws.\n\n**Tournament Consideration:**\nAs a short stack, I should be looking for spots to get my money in with decent equity. This is NOT that spot. I have:\n1. No hand strength\n2. No draws\n3. I would be committing 39% of my stack\n4. Even if I call and hit a queen on turn, I might still be behind to Kx, Tx, 7x\n\nThe best play here is to fold and preserve my 50 chips for a better spot where I have actual hand strength or decent equity.\n\nI could consider shoving all-in as a bluff, but:\n- That would be 82 chips to win 128 (pot + opponent's bet)\n- Risking my tournament life on a pure bluff with Q-high\n- Opponent might call with any pair or draw\n- This is too high risk for the situation\n\n**Decision: FOLD**",

In hand 81 they called 187 which is significant.\n\nGiven my situation:\n- I'm extremely short stacked (2.1 BB)\n- QJo is a decent hand for a short stack shove\n- The pot is already 48, and I have 66\n- If I call 16, I'll have 50 left and be pot-committed\n- I could raise to 64 (leaving me with 2 chips)\n- Or I could just shove all-in for 66\n\nFrom a tournament perspective, with 2.1 BB, I need to make a move soon. QJo on the button is definitely strong enough to shove with this stack size. The opponent is the big stack who can afford to call, but they've shown they can fold preflop too.\n\nThe best play here is to shove all-in. This maximizes fold equity and puts maximum pressure. Even if called, QJo has decent equity against most calling ranges.\n\nLet me think about the raise sizing. Minimum raise is to 64, but I have 66. I should just shove all-in for 66.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ks 6h is a very weak hand, especially out of position (BB). It's not suited, not connected, and King-high with a weak kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB (big blind) which is the worst position post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in SB (seat 4) and has limped in (called 16 after posting SB). Their stack is 718 chips (22.4 BB), which is quite healthy.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n   - Folding frequently preflop (hands 76, 78, 80, 83)\n   - Occasionally calling (hands 81, 82)\n   - Occasionally raising (hand 79)\n   - Post-flop, they bet on hand 82 but folded on hand 77\n\n   This suggests a somewhat tight player who folds often but can occasionally play hands.\n\n5. **Stack Size**: I have only 82 chips (2.6 BB), which is critically short. This is a tournament survival situation.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 64 chips, and I can check to see a free flop. That's good pot odds.\n\n7. **Tournament Consideration**: With 2.6 BB, I'm in desperate need of chips. However, K6o is a terrible hand to risk my tournament life on. I should only be playing premium hands or looking for good spots to shove.\n\n8. **Post-flop play**: If I check, I'll be out of position with a weak hand. If I hit a King, I'll have kicker problems. If I hit a 6, it's unlikely to be good.\n\nGiven my extremely short stack, I need to be very selective. While I could check and see a free flop, K6o is just too weak to play out of position, even with the pot odds. The risk of getting trapped or losing more chips post-flop is high.\n\nWith only 2.6 BB left, I should save my chips for a better spot - ideally when I have a stronger hand or better position, or when I can be the aggressor rather than calling from the blinds.\n\nThe best play here is to fold and preserve my few remaining chips for a better opportunity.",

Any Ace beats me, and there are many better Kings possible.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm extremely short. If I check and opponent bets, I might be forced to fold or call off my stack with a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 64 chips and I have 82 chips. This is a huge pot relative to my stack.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 2.6 BB, I'm in critical need of chips. I can't afford to wait for a better spot.\n\n5. **Opponent's action**: They just called from SB preflop, which could mean a wide range. The check on the flop suggests they might not have an Ace.\n\n**My options:**\n- **Check**: Risk letting opponent see a free card when I'm vulnerable. If they bet, I'll be in a tough spot with top pair weak kicker.\n- **Raise**: I could shove all-in for 82 chips into a 64 chip pot. This would be a protection bet with my top pair. Given my stack size, this might be the best play to maximize fold equity and avoid difficult decisions on later streets.\n\nGiven that I'm extremely short-stacked (2.6 BB) with top pair on a scary board, checking is too passive. I need to apply pressure now while I might have the best hand. A shove gives me fold equity and protects against draws and better hands that might check behind.\n\nI should go all-in now.",

No suitedness, no connectivity, just one high card.\n\n2. **Stack situation**: I'm extremely short stacked at 4.1 BB. This is critical tournament survival territory. I need to be very selective.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but my hand is too weak.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (pot) = 25% pot odds. Even with my short stack, this is not a good spot.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 4.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling here would leave me with 114 chips (3.6 BB) and I'd be out of position post-flop. This is terrible for my tournament life.\n\n6. **Opponent tendency**: MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop often but folds to aggression post-flop. However, with Q2o I have very little equity even if I hit.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q2o is not a hand to risk tournament life with, even from the button. I should preserve my 4.1 BB for a better spot - ideally when I can shove preflop with some fold equity or with a much stronger hand. Calling here just bleeds chips and leaves me in bad shape.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm in the SB and already posted 16. The BB is 32. So I need to call 16 more to see the flop. But with 130 chips (4.1 BB), calling 16 chips is about 12% of my stack. That's significant.\n\nWith Q2o, I have very poor equity. Even on the button (which I'm not - I'm in SB), this is a fold. The fact that I'm short stacked makes it an even clearer fold. I need to wait for a better spot to get my chips in.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My cards: 2d 7h - This is a terrible hand. 2-7 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n- My stack: 130 chips (4.1 BB) - I'm very short-stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 (to complete the small blind)\n- Minimum raise to: 64\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 2-7 offsuit is extremely weak. No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. This is a fold in almost every situation.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: I have 130 chips which is 4.1 big blinds. This is critically short. In tournament poker with such a short stack, I need to be looking for spots to get all-in with decent hands.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the Button which is the best position, but with 2-7 offsuit this doesn't help much.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 to win a pot of 48, giving me 3:1 odds. But even with these odds, 2-7 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 4.1 BB, I need to preserve my chips for a better spot. I should be looking to shove with any decent hand (any pair, any Ace, any King, any suited connector, etc.). 2-7 offsuit is not a shoving hand.\n\n6. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the BB with 686 chips (deep stack)\n   - Only one opponent to act after me since others have folded\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm short-stacked and getting 3:1 pot odds, 2-7 offsuit is just too weak. I need to wait for a better hand to risk my tournament life. The fact that I only have one opponent left (the BB) doesn't change this - 2-7 offsuit is dominated by virtually any hand the BB might have.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot, preferably when I can shove all-in with a hand that has some equity.",

I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n3. **Pot odds**: There's 96 in the pot, I need to call 32.

While the pot odds are decent, my hand is terrible and I'm too short-stacked to mess around with marginal spots. I need to preserve my chips for a better opportunity - ideally with a stronger hand or in a blind vs blind situation where I can shove with fold equity.\n\nIf I were to raise, minimum raise to is 96, which would leave me with only 2 chips.

I cannot afford to play speculative hands.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions (Seat 4, BB):\n- Hand 79: Raised preflop to 32\n- Hand 80: Folded preflop\n- Hand 81: Called 187 (big call)\n- Hand 82: Called 16, then bet 32 on flop\n- Hand 83: Folded preflop\n- Hand 84: Called 16, folded on flop\n- Hand 86: Folded preflop\n- Hand 88: Raised preflop to 64\n\nShowdowns show they've had strong hands: AA multiple times, 77.\n\nThis opponent seems to be fairly active and has shown they can raise preflop. With my short stack, if I call 16, I'll have 66 chips left (2 BB). If I raise to 64, I'll have 18 chips left.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith T2o and a stack of 2.6 BB, this is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting pot odds (calling 16 to win 48, so 3:1), my hand has very poor equity against any reasonable range. \n\nThe only consideration might be if I want to shove all-in as a steal, but:\n1. My hand is too weak\n2. The BB has shown they can call/raise preflop\n3. I only have 2.6 BB, so it's not much pressure\n\n\n4. In a tournament, preserving these chips is crucial for a better opportunity\n\nI'll conserve my limited chips, waiting for a more favorable situation to make a move. The risk-reward ratio simply doesn't justify playing this hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB with K-10 offsuit\n- My stack: 50 chips (1.6 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) is the only active player who called from SB\n- My legal actions: fold, check, or raise to 64 (all-in)\n\n**Stack analysis:**\n- I have 50 chips left, which is less than the minimum raise amount (64)\n- This means if I want to raise, I can only go all-in for my remaining 50 chips\n- Since I posted 32 as BB, I have 18 chips remaining (50 - 32 = 18)\n\nWait, let me recalculate: I posted BB of 32, and I started with 50 chips, so I have 18 chips left. But the pot shows 64 (32 from me + 16 from SB + 16 from SB's call). Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the actions:\n- Seat 4 posted SB 16\n- Seat 1 (me) posted BB 32\n- Seat 4 called 16 (completing the call to match my BB)\n\nSo the pot is 16 (SB) + 32 (my BB) + 16 (call) = 64.\n\nAnd I have 50 - 32 = 18 chips remaining.\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- K-10 offsuit is a decent hand, especially when I'm very short stacked\n- It's well ahead of random hands\n- From BB, I get to see a free flop if I check\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- They call from SB position (hand 82, 84) and then bet on flop or fold\n- They raise preflop from SB position (hand 72, 76, 79, 88)\n- When they raise, it's usually to 32 or 64\n- They seem to be active and aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm extremely short stacked at 1.6 BB\n- The pot is already 64 chips\n- I only have 18 chips left\n- This is a clear all-in or fold situation\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Terrible option. I'd be left with 18 chips and the BB would still be 32 next hand, so I'd be forced all-in anyway.\n\n\n2. **Check**: I can see a free flop with K-10, but with only 18 chips left, I'll be pot-committed on any flop\n3. **Raise (all-in)**: Go all-in for my remaining 18 chips\n\nI'll go all-in to maximize my fold equity and protect my hand. With such a short stack, this is my best chance to double up or force a fold. The pot odds make this a mathematically sound decision, and my K-10 is strong enough to justify the risk.\n\nThe all-in move gives me two ways to win: either my opponent folds, or I have the best hand. It's a classic short-stack tournament play that could potentially save my tournament life.",

I'm extremely short-stacked with only 3.1 BB\n2. I have a terrible hand (J-2 suited)\n3. I'm on the button which is good position\n4. The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with 718 chips (big stack)\n5. I have to call 16 chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Frequently folds preflop (hands 73, 75, 78, 80, 83, 86, 90)\n- Sometimes raises (hands 76, 79, 88)\n- Sometimes calls (hands 81, 82, 84, 90)\n- Generally seems to play somewhat tight/standard\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith only 3.1 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to find spots to either:\n1. Shove all-in with a decent hand\n2. Steal blinds when possible\n3. Preserve my stack for a better opportunity\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\nJ-2 suited is a terrible hand. Even in position, this is not a hand I want to invest chips with. The only redeeming quality is that it's suited, but the ranks are too low.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 48, I need to call 16. That's 3:1 pot odds. But with my stack size and hand strength, this is not relevant - I should either fold or shove, not call.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 3.1 BB and J-2 suited, this is a clear fold. I need to preserve my tiny stack for a much better spot. Even though I'm on the button and could try to steal, the hand is just too weak. I should wait for at least a decent hand (any pair, any Ace, any two Broadway cards, or at least one high card with connectivity).\n\nThe only argument for playing would be if I think the big blind folds very often, but even then, J-2 is too weak to risk 16% of my stack on a steal attempt when I could find a much better spot.",

I need to consider:\n\n**Hand strength**: Ad 3s is marginal. It's an ace, but with a weak kicker. Against a random hand, it has about 55-60% equity. Against a typical raising range, it's much worse.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 96, getting 3:1 odds. That's 25% equity needed to break even.\n\n**Stack preservation**: With 2.1 BB, I'm in critical territory. However, I also need to take spots to double up.\n\n**Opponent tendency**: MiniMax-M2 has shown they can raise from SB (did it in hand #88). They have a big stack and can apply pressure.\n\n**Tournament situation**: With such a short stack, I should be looking for spots to get all-in. However, Ad 3s is not a great hand to do it with, especially against a raise from the opponent.\n \nI recognize the critical nature of my chip situation. The 3:1 pot odds are mathematically tempting, but my extremely short stack demands caution. Calling would commit nearly half my remaining chips, leaving me critically vulnerable on the flop. \n\nWith a marginal ace and limited chips, the strategic move is to fold. This preserves my last 34 chips, buying me time to find a better opportunity to push all-in with a stronger hand or more favorable position. The risk of being dominated by a better ace or strong pocket pair makes this fold the most prudent tournament survival strategy.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my situation:\n- I have Kc 3s on the button\n- My stack is only 50 chips (1.6 BB) - I'm extremely short-stacked\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- I'm in the SB position (seat 1) but it says I'm BTN (button) - this seems inconsistent, but the blinds show I posted 16 as SB\n- I need to call 16 to complete the BB (since I posted SB)\n- Pot is 48 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 is in BB with 766 chips (big stack)\n\nFrom the opponent analysis:\nMiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 73, 75, 78, 80, 83, 86)\n- Raising sometimes (hands 76, 79, 88, 92) - usually to 32 or 64\n- Calling occasionally (hands 81, 82, 84, 90)\n- When they call preflop, they often bet on the flop (hand 82) or fold on flop (hands 77, 84)\n\nGiven my situation:\n1. I'm extremely short-stacked with only 1.6 BB\n2. I have K3o - a very weak hand\n3. I need to call 16 to see a flop, which would leave me with only 34 chips\n4. The pot is 48, giving me 3:1 immediate pot odds\n5. As a short stack, I need to be looking for spots to get my money in with decent equity\n\nWith K3o, even against a random hand, I have about 45-50% equity. But I'm out of position against the big stack.\n\nThe key consideration: I'm down to 1.6 BB. In tournament poker, when you're this short, you often need to take any decent spot to shove or call. However, K3o is really weak, and I'd be calling off 32% of my stack (16/50) just to see a flop out of position.\n\nThe better play here is to fold and wait for a better spot. \n\nI'll preserve my remaining 50 chips for a more favorable opportunity. With such a short stack, every chip is precious, and risking 32% on a marginal hand like K3o isn't strategically sound. I'll maintain my patience and look for a stronger hand or better position to make my move.",

Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm extremely short-stacked at 1.6 BB. This is critical tournament situation.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in BB with 766 chips (big stack). Looking at their recent actions:\n   - They've been active: folding, calling, raising\n   - They've made preflop raises of 64 chips (2x BB) in hands 88 and 92\n   - They seem to defend their BB sometimes but also fold to pressure\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1 odds). This might seem tempting with a short stack, but...\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With only 1.6 BB, I need to be very selective. While I could call and see a flop, if I miss (very likely with J4o), I'll be left with just 34 chips and still in terrible position.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with such a weak hand and short stack, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and I'm extremely short, J4 offsuit has such poor equity that it's not worth the risk. I need to preserve my last 50 chips for a better spot - ideally when I can be the aggressor with a stronger hand or when I have better pot odds preflop. Calling here would leave me with 34 chips and still needing to hit a miracle flop.\n\nFolding keeps my 50 chips intact for a better opportunity.",

I'm extremely short-stacked with only 18 chips left (0.6 BB)\n2. I have a terrible hand: 5c 3c (offsuit, low cards)\n3. The pot is already 64 chips\n4. I can check for free (amount to call is 0)\n5. MiniMax-M2 is the only active opponent with a healthy stack of 782 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data, I see MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 83, 86, 94)\n- Calling sometimes (hands 84, 90)\n- Raising occasionally (hands 88, 92)\n\nThis suggests they're playing relatively tight but not extremely so.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 5c 3c is terrible - only about 30-35% equity against a random hand\n2. **Stack size**: I'm desperate with 0.6 BB left\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 64 and I can see the flop for free\n4. **Tournament situation**: I need to make a move soon or I'll blind out\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I can check and see a free flop, hoping to hit something\n- Even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated\n- However, with my stack size, any pair might be worth shoving on the flop\n- The pot is already 64 chips, and I only have 18 left - if I win, I triple up\n\n**My thought process:**\nGiven that I can see the flop for free and I'm extremely short-stacked, checking makes sense. Even with a terrible hand, I need to take any free opportunity to potentially win chips. If I fold, I lose 32 chips (the BB I posted) and will be in even worse shape next hand with only 18 chips left.\n\nThe risk is minimal (it's free to check), and the potential reward is significant (winning a 64 chip pot would triple my stack).\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5c 3c - I have bottom pair (5s) on a board of 7d 5d Qh. This is very weak.\n2. **My stack**: 18 chips (0.6 BB) - I'm extremely short stacked.\n3. **Position**: BB (out of position)\n4. **Board**: 7d 5d Qh - Two diamonds, so a flush draw is possible. I have bottom pair with a weak kicker.\n5. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) bet 32 into a 96 pot. I need to call 32.\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 96, I need to call 32, so 3:1 pot odds. If I call, I have 0 chips left (18-32 would be negative).\n\nWait, let me recalculate. The pot is 96 before the bet. MiniMax bet 32, making the pot 128. I need to call 32 to win 128, which is 4:1 pot odds. But I only have 18 chips, so I can't even make the call - I'd have to go all-in for 18.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes again - I have 18 chips. The bet is 32. I cannot call 32. My only options are fold or go all-in for 18. But the legal actions shown are just \"fold, call\" - this suggests I can call 18 (all-in).\n\nLet me think about MiniMax's tendencies from the history:\n- Hand 82: Flop bet 32 (similar to this hand)\n- Hand 84: Preflop call 16, then flop fold\n- Hand 88: Preflop raise 64\n- Hand 90: Preflop call 16, then fold\n- Hand 92: Preflop raise 64\n\nMiniMax seems to be playing fairly aggressively preflop with raises, and making continuation bets on the flop.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have bottom pair with a terrible kicker\n- I'm extremely short stacked (0.6 BB)\n- I'm out of position\n- There's a possible flush draw and I could be drawing dead to many hands\n- I have no fold equity since I'd be calling all-in\n\nEven with 4:1 pot odds, I don't think calling with bottom pair and no kicker is profitable here. I'm likely behind to any Q, any 7, any pocket pair, any diamond draw, etc. The only hands I'm ahead of are pure bluffs or hands like A-high.\n\nWith such a short stack, I should be looking for much better spots. This is a clear fold.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider - I only have 18 chips left. The pot is 128. If I go all-in for 18, I'm getting about 7:1 on my money. But I'm almost certainly behind. Let me think about what hands I could be ahead of:\n- A pure bluff (but why bluff when I have so few chips?)\n- A smaller pair (but there are no smaller pairs than 5s except maybe 2s, 3s, or 4s)\n- Ace-high\n\nI'm behind to:\n- Any pair of 7s or Qs\n- Any diamond draw (which has many outs)\n- Any hand with a 5 and better kicker\n- Any overpair\n\nGiven the texture and the opponent's bet, I think I'm beat way too often. This is a fold.\n\nWait, I should double-check my stack. The prompt says \"Your Stack: 18 chips (0.6 BB)\" and blinds are 16/32. 18 chips is indeed less than 1 big blind. I'm in a very desperate situation.\n\nBut even in desperate situations, I need to make good decisions. With bottom pair and no kicker on this board, I'm not in good shape. The opponent's bet of 32 into 96 is a small bet (1/3 pot), which could be a value bet with a strong hand or a c-bet with air.\n\nGiven my extreme short stack, some might argue for going all-in here to maximize fold equity and take advantage of pot odds. But I have NO fold equity - the opponent has already bet, and calling 18 more into a pot of 128 is trivial for them if they have any piece.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot, even though my stack is tiny. With 5c 3c, I don't even have a good chance of improving - I have 2 outs to trips (the remaining 5s), and that's it. If I'm against a flush draw, they have 9 outs. If I'm against a better pair, I have 2 outs. If I'm against two pair or a set, I'm drawing dead.\n\nThis is a fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB with 5c 3c\n- Flop: 7d 5d Qh\n- I have bottom pair (5s)\n- My stack: 18 chips (very short, less than 1 BB)\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) bet 32\n- I need to call 32, but I only have 18 chips total\n\n**Key points:**\n1. I have bottom pair with a weak kicker\n2. There's a flush draw on board (2 diamonds)\n3. My stack is extremely short (18 chips, which is 0.6 BB)\n4. I cannot even afford the full call of 32 - I can only go all-in for 18\n5. The pot is already 96, so I'm getting great pot odds if I could call\n\n**Analysis:**\n- With 18 chips left and the pot at 96, if I could call 32, I'd be getting 3:1 pot odds\n- But I can only put in 18 chips total, so I'd be calling 18 to win 96 (5.33:1 odds)\n- I have bottom pair which might be good, but could easily be behind\n- The Q on board could easily have hit my opponent\n- There's a flush draw I don't have\n\n**Decision:**\nSince I can only fold or call (can't raise), and I have bottom pair with such a short stack, I need to think about tournament survival vs. chip accumulation.\n\nActually, wait - I need to re-read. The amount to call is 32, but I only have 18 chips. In poker, when you don't have enough to call a full bet, you can go all-in. So my options are:\n- Fold\n- Call all-in for my remaining 18 chips\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have some equity with bottom pair\n2. The pot is already 96 chips\n3. I'm extremely short-stacked and need to make a move soon\n4. I'm getting ~5.3:1 on my money\n\nBut also:\n- My hand is very weak (bottom pair, bad kicker)\n- There's a Q on board which likely hits opponent's range\n- There's a flush draw\n\nI think this is a fold. I have very little equity with bottom pair, and even though I'm short, I should wait for a better spot. The Q is very scary, and I could easily be drawing to 5 outs (two more 5s) at best, or could already be drawing dead.\n\n\nI'll fold this hand, preserving my minimal stack for a more promising opportunity. The risk outweighs the potential gain with such a weak holding.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3s Th - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a low kicker.\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but with my tiny stack it doesn't matter much.\n3. **My stack**: 2 chips (0.1 BB) - This is critically short, almost nothing left.\n4. **Blinds**: 16/32 - The big blind is 32 chips\n5. **Pot**: 48 chips\n6. **Amount to call**: 16 chips (to complete my small blind)\n7. **Legal actions**: fold, call (no raise option)\n\nGiven that I have 2 chips and need to call 16, I actually can't afford to call. The system says \"Amount to call: 16\" but I only have 2 chips. This means I would be all-in if I call.\n\nLet me think about the pot odds:\n- Pot is 48 chips\n- I need to put in my remaining 2 chips\n- Pot odds: 48:2 or 24:1\n\nWith 3s Th, this is a terrible hand. However, with my stack being so short (0.1 BB), and the pot odds being 24:1, I need to consider if it's worth taking a chance.\n\nLet me check the opponent's behavior:\n- MiniMax-M2 is in the BB with 814 chips (deep stack)\n- Looking at their preflop actions: they fold a lot, call sometimes, and raise occasionally\n- They seem to be a fairly straightforward player\n\nWith my hand of 3s Th:\n- Very low chance of winning\n- I'm almost certainly dominated by any hand that calls\n- Even with 24:1 pot odds, this hand is just too weak\n\nHowever, I have a critical stack situation:\n- I have 0.1 BB left\n- If I fold, I'll have 2 chips and be in the BB next hand where I'll have to put in 32 chips (which I don't have)\n- This means if I fold, I'll be all-in next hand anyway in the BB\n\nSo my choices are:\n1. Fold now, then be forced all-in next hand in BB with random cards\n2. Call now with 3s Th and be all-in\n\nGiven that I'll be all-in next hand anyway, and the pot odds are 24:1, I should probably call now and take my chances with 3s Th.\n \nI realize the tournament situation demands immediate action. With an extremely short stack and mandatory all-in scenarios in both current and next hands, calling now seems mathematically prudent. The marginal difference between folding and calling is negligible given my dire chip position. Taking the 24:1 pot odds with my current hand represents the most strategic option, despite the hand's inherent weakness.\n\nI'll commit my remaining chips and hope for the best possible outcome, recognizing this is likely my final hand of the tournament.",

          "reasoning_content": "  We need to decide on an action for Hand #1 - Preflop. We are Seat 1 (BTN) with Ah Qc. We have 200 chips (100 BB). Blinds are 1/2. Pot is 11 chips. Actions: Seat 2 posted SB 1, Seat 3 posted BB 2, Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called 4. So we are facing a raise of 4 (which is a min-raise? Actually seat 4 raised to 4, which is a raise of 2 over the BB of 2? Wait blinds are 1/2, so SB is 1, BB is 2. Seat 4 raised to 4, which is a raise of 2 (i.e., a min-raise). Seat 5 called. So we are on the BTN, facing a raise to 4. We have Ah Qc. We need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nWe have a strong hand: AQ offsuit is a premium hand, especially on the BTN. The raise is small (to 4). The pot is 11 chips. We have 200 chips. We can call, raise, or fold. We need to consider opponent tendencies. We can use tools to recall opponent actions.\n\nWe have tools: recall_my_hands, search_opponent_actions, recall_opponent_actions. We need to search for opponent actions. We need to recall opponent actions for specific opponents. The opponents are Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Seat 2 and Seat 3 are SB and BB respectively. But we need to recall opponent actions for these opponents.\n\nWe need to decide on an action. Let's think.\n\nWe have Ah Qc. This is a strong hand. The raise is small. The BTN is a good position. We can call or raise. We can also fold, but that would be too tight. We need to consider opponent tendencies. Let's search for opponent actions.\n\nWe can use search_opponent_actions with query \"MiniMax-M2\" or \"GPT-OSS-120B\". But we need to know what they have done in past hands. However we have no memory of past hands. This is Hand #1. So there is no prior history. So we cannot recall any opponent actions. So we need to rely on default assumptions.\n\nThus we should treat this as a standard scenario: BTN vs a small raise from MP (Seat 4) and a call from CO (Seat 5). The raise is small, indicating possibly a weak hand or a trapping hand. But we have no reads. So we should treat this as a standard situation: BTN with AQ offsuit facing a small raise and a call. We should raise for value and to isolate. We can raise to something like 12-16 chips. The minimum raise to is 6 (i.e., we can raise to at least 6). But we can raise larger. We have 200 chips. We can raise to 12 or 14. Let's decide.\n\nWe need to consider the pot: currently 11 chips (SB 1, BB 2, raise 4, call 4). If we raise to 12, that is a raise of 8 over the current bet of 4. So we would be putting 12 chips. That would be a decent size. If we raise to 14, that is a raise of 10. We can also raise to 16. But we need to consider that we are out of position relative to the blinds? Actually we are on the BTN, which is the best position. So we can raise to isolate and get value from weaker hands.\n\nThus we should raise. Let's raise to 12. That is a standard 3x the raise size (the raise was 4, so 3x would be 12). Or we could raise to 14. But 12 is fine.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning: we have a premium hand AQ, we are on the BTN, we want to isolate and build pot, we have position.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 12, reasoning: \"BTN with AQ offsuit is a premium hand; facing a small raise and a call, we want to isolate and build pot; we have position.\"\n\nThus we output JSON.\n\nBut we need to ensure we follow the exact format: {\"action\": \"raise\", \"raise_to\": 12, \"reasoning\": \"...\"}.\n\nWe need to ensure we include \"raise_to\" only if raising. Yes.\n\nThus final answer.\n\nBut before final, let's double-check the rules: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". So if we raise to 12, that is the total amount we put in. That is correct.\n\nWe need to ensure we do not exceed our",

This board could hit:\n- Pocket pairs (sets with 55, 66, 22)\n- Straight draws (34, 47, 78)\n- Two pairs (65, 52, 62)\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in position (on the button) which is great. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- Me: 188 chips\n- Seat 4: 188 chips\n- Seat 5: 188 chips\n\n**Decision Point:**\nI can check or bet. Let me think about what to do:\n\n1. **Check**: This gives me a free card to try to hit my Ace or Queen. It keeps the pot small. If I miss the turn, I can evaluate based on their action.\n\n\n2. **Bet**: This is a good spot for a continuation bet. I showed strength preflop with a 3-bet, and this board is relatively dry. My opponents' checks suggest weakness, making a bet potentially profitable. A half-pot bet of around 20 chips could pressure them to fold marginal hands. \n\nI'll analyze my opponents' likely holdings. Seat 4's initial raise suggests a strong range, possibly pocket pairs 77+ or strong broadway hands. Seat 5's flat call indicates a slightly wider but still cautious range. The coordinated low board might have connected with their ranges in unexpected ways, so I'll need to be cautious about potential sets or two-pair hands.\n\nThe preflop action provides interesting dynamics. Seat 4's 2x raise and Seat 5's flat call create a multi-way pot that could conceal various hand strengths. My 3-bet to 12 represents significant aggression, which both opponents chose to call, indicating potential strength or speculative holdings.\n\nKey observations emerge: the small flop size suggests potential vulnerability, and the coordinated nature of the board might favor drawing hands. With 39 chips already in the pot and 176 chips behind, I have substantial room for strategic maneuvering.\n\nThe preflop ranges for both opponents seem weighted towards pocket pairs, broadway cards, and potential suited connectors. Their flop checks could signal uncertainty or a desire to control pot size.\n\nMy aggressive preflop image provides an opportunity to continue applying pressure. A continuation bet would represent strength, potentially folding out weaker holdings while maintaining initiative in the hand.\n\nI'm considering a 20-chip bet, which represents about half the pot. This sizing allows me to maintain control while not overcommitting if faced with resistance. The goal is to capitalize on my perceived strength and potentially take down the pot immediately.\n\nHowever, the coordinated board texture gives me pause. While I have two overcards, the potential for opponents to have connected in multiple ways suggests caution might be prudent. Checking could allow me to gather more information on the turn without risking additional chips.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on balancing aggression with pot control, weighing the benefits of a continuation bet against the risks of potentially inflating the pot with a marginal holding.\n\nMy preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and opponents likely perceive me as having premium hands. The dry flop texture actually favors my perceived range, making a continuation bet strategically sound. A half-pot bet of 20 chips could effectively leverage my table image and potentially take down the pot.\n\nI'm considering checking to manage pot size and preserve my stack. With 188 chips, I have flexibility, but I want to avoid unnecessary risks. Checking allows me to see the turn card without committing more chips, which aligns with a more conservative approach given my current hand strength.\n\nThe key is balancing aggression with prudent stack management, weighing the potential benefits of a continuation bet against the risk of overcommitting with a marginal holding.\n\nI'll analyze the board texture and opponent behaviors to make the most strategic decision, focusing on preserving my tournament life while maintaining an opportunity"

          "content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Ah Qc\n- Stack: 168 chips (84 BB)\n- Board: 5c 6d 2s 7d\n- Pot: 119 chips\n- Current action: Seat 4 bet 20, Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 20 to continue\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have Ah Qc - Ace high\n- Board: 5c 6d 2s 7d\n- No pair, no draw really. Just Ace high\n- However, this is a very coordinated board with straight possibilities (3-4, 3-7, 4-8, etc.)\n- There's also a potential flush draw with three clubs on board (5c, 2s, 7d - wait, only 5c is a club, 2s is spade, 7d is diamond. Let me recount: 5c, 6d, 2s, 7d - actually only one club. So no flush draw yet.\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called, I 3-bet to 12, both called\n- Flop: I bet 20, both called\n- Turn: Seat 4 leads out for 20, Seat 5 folds\n\nThis is interesting. Seat 4 called my 3-bet preflop, called my flop bet, and now is leading the turn. Seat 5 was in between but folded.\n\nLet me think about what Seat 4 might have:\n- They raised preflop from early position (seat 4 is MP)\n- Called a 3-bet\n- Called a flop bet\n- Now betting the turn\n\nThe board is 5-6-2-7. This hits a lot of hands that would raise preflop:\n- Pairs: 77, 66, 55, 22 would all be strong\n- Straight draws: 34, 48, 89 for open-ended\n- Overpairs: 88-TT might play this way\n- Two pairs: 75, 76, 65, etc.\n\n\n- I need to consider my tournament position carefully\n- My chip stack is relatively healthy at 84 BB\n- The pot is getting substantial at 119 chips\n- Calling risks 20 chips, which is about 12% of my stack\n- The potential loss could impact my tournament standing\n\nI'm realizing my initial flush draw assessment was incorrect. The board actually shows limited flush potential. This means my Ace-high hand is even weaker than I first thought. The turn bet from Seat 4 suggests they have a made hand or strong draw. With my current holding, folding seems the most prudent move to protect my chip stack and tournament position. I need to consider the betting patterns and potential opponent strategies. The small turn bet suggests either a defensive move with a vulnerable hand or a strategic probe bet. My preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and my flop bet indicates confidence. \n\nOpponents' actions reveal interesting dynamics: Seat 4's consistent calls and turn bet hint at a moderately strong hand, while Seat 5's fold suggests weakness. The pot odds of nearly 7:1 make calling tempting, but the risk of facing a larger river bet is significant.\n\nI'm analyzing potential hand ranges, recognizing that many would have shown more aggression earlier if they were truly premium hands. The turn bet sizing feels like a potential blocker or defensive maneuver, trying to control the pot's progression.\n\nMy stack size of 168 chips provides some flexibility, but I must weigh the potential river scenarios carefully. The strategic implications of calling versus folding require precise calculation of potential outcomes and opponent tendencies.\n\nThe pot odds of nearly 7:1 initially seem attractive, but the underlying strategic complexity suggests a more nuanced decision is necessary. I'm sensing this might be a subtle trap, where the immediate pot odds could mask longer-term strategic disadvantages.\n\nA 20-chip call represents a calculated risk - small enough to preserve my stack, yet potentially revealing critical information about my opponent's hand strength. However, the risk of escalating commitment on the river looms large, potentially transforming a small call into a more significant loss.\n\nThe key consideration is whether this turn call provides enough strategic value to justify the potential downstream risks. My tournament position and overall chip preservation strategy must take precedence over short-term pot odds.\n\nWith no strong draw and only Ace-high, I'm inclined to make a disciplined fold. This decision protects my 148-chip stack and avoids getting drawn into a potentially expensive confrontation where I'm likely behind.\n\nThe hand's history suggests some strength from Seat 4, and my current holding doesn't justify continued investment. Preserving chips for more favorable situations seems the wisest approach.\n\nI'll use the search tool to review my previous plays and confirm"

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #2 - PREFLOP**\n- My Position: UTG (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 6s Js (suited connectors, 6 and Jack of spades)\n- My Stack: 168 chips (84.0 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Players: 5 active players (Seat 5 folded)\n- I need to call 2 chips to see the flop\n\nLet me think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: 6s Js is a marginal hand UTG. It's suited but the cards are disconnected (gap). This is not a strong hand from early position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I will be out of position post-flop against everyone.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the hand history I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Raised to 4 (2x BB) in Hand #1, then called a 3-bet to 12. Seems somewhat loose/passive.\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Folded in Hand #1 after a raise.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Folded in Hand #1.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Called a raise in Hand #1.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have 84 BB, which is a comfortable stack.\n   - From UTG, I should be playing tight.\n   - The pot is small (3 chips), and I need to call 2 chips.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not great for a speculative hand.\n\n6. **Stack Preservation**: From UTG with a marginal hand, folding is the standard play. Calling or raising would be loose.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold from UTG with J6s. It's too weak to play from early position, especially out of position post-flop. I don't have enough information to justify playing this hand speculatively.\n\nLet me check if there are any other observations I should make:\n- The hand history shows opponents are playing somewhat standard.\n- No one has shown extreme aggression or passivity patterns yet.\n- From UTG, I should be playing very tight.\n\nI should fold this hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8s 5h - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. It's not a hand I want to play in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 166 chips (83 BB) - This is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - Small blind (Seat 5) posted 1 chip\n   - I posted big blind of 2 chips\n   - Everyone folded to the small blind\n   - Small blind called the additional 1 chip (limped in)\n\n5. **Pot**: Currently 4 chips\n6. **To call**: 0 (I can check)\n7. **Legal actions**: fold, check, raise\n\n8. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Hand 1: Called preflop, called a raise, called flop bet, folded on turn\n   - Hand 2: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 3: Checked through entire hand, folded on river\n   - This suggests a somewhat passive player who doesn't fold to aggression easily but also doesn't show much aggression themselves\n\n**Decision factors**:\n- My hand is very weak (85o) - one of the worst hands in poker\n- I'm out of position postflop (small blind will act first)\n- The small blind just limped, which often indicates a weak/marginal hand\n- I could check and see a free flop, but even if I hit something, it's unlikely to be strong\n- Raising would be a bluff/steal attempt, but with 85o I have very little equity if called\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips), so there's not much to win\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a decent stack (83 BB), so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- Stealing the 4-chip pot isn't worth the risk with such a weak hand\n- Better to preserve my chips for better spots\n\nThe best play here is to **check** and see a free flop, or possibly fold. Since checking is free and I have position postflop, checking makes more sense than folding. If I hit something strong (like two pair or better), I could potentially win a bigger pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 85o, even checking might be questionable. But since it's free to check and I'm in position, I'll check and see if I can hit something. The risk is minimal.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 8s 5h - Very weak hand, no pair, no draw, just 8-high\n\n**Board:** 4h Td 2s Kd 4d\n- Final board shows: 4-4-T-K-d (two diamonds)\n- Possible hands:\n  - Any pair beats me\n  - Two pairs, sets, straights, flushes all beat me\n  - I have absolutely nothing - just 8-high\n\n**Situation:**\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Villain (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) bet 2 on the river\n- I need to call 2 to win 8 (6+2) = 4:1 pot odds\n- I have 166 chips, so calling costs me very little relative to my stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- Hand 1: Called preflop, called flop bet of 20, folded on turn\n- Hand 2: Folded preflop  \n- Hand 3: Checked through entire hand, folded on river\n- Hand 4 (current): Posted SB, called preflop, checked flop/turn, now betting river\n\nPattern: This opponent seems passive/trappy. They've shown willingness to call bets but also check often. The river bet here is unusual for them based on the limited history - this is their first river bet shown.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have 8-high, which is essentially the worst possible hand here. I cannot beat ANY pair, any two pair, any set, any straight, any flush. The only hands I beat are complete bluffs with 7-high or worse.\n\n2. **Board texture:** The board has paired (4s), has a King, and a possible flush draw came in on the river (4d). This is a scary board that could hit many hands.\n\n3. **Opponent's line:** They checked flop and turn, then bet small on river (2 into 6 pot = 1/3 pot). This could be:\n   - A value bet with a made hand (pair, two pair, trips, etc.)\n   - A bluff trying to steal the pot\n   - A thin value bet with a weak hand\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 2 to win 8, getting 4:1 odds. This means I need to win at least 20% of the time to break even.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack (83 BB). Losing 2 chips won't hurt me, but it's still burning chips with a very weak hand.\n\n**Decision:** I have 8-high with no draw, no pair. Even though the pot odds are decent (4:1), I need to win 20% of the time. Given that my opponent checked twice and now bets river, they're representing some strength. With 8-high, I lose to:\n- Any pair (and there are many pairs possible)\n- Any King\n- Any flush\n- Any two pair/trips\n\nThe only way I win is if they're bluffing with complete air. While possible, it's not likely enough to justify calling with 8-high. This is a clear fold.\n\nI should not raise as a bluff because:\n1. I have no equity if called\n2. The opponent has shown they'll call bets (called 20 chip bet in hand 1)\n3. My stack is healthy, no need to make desperate moves\n4. The board is scary and could easily have hit their range",

The raise in this hand (Hand 5) is only a min-raise to 4.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 3 to win 7, which is about 30% pot odds.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: AcTs is a decent speculative hand. It has good playability postflop, especially in position.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 seems relatively tight but is only making a min-raise here.\n4. **Stack sizes**: Both players have deep stacks (82+ BB), so implied odds are good if I hit a strong hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Calling 3 chips (1.5 BB) with a speculative hand in position seems like a good investment.\n\nI could also consider a 3-bet to 6 chips. However, given that:\n- MiniMax-M2 seems somewhat tight\n- I have position\n- Aces with weak kickers can be problematic if I hit an Ace\n- I want to keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n\nI think calling is the best option. It allows me to see the flop cheaply, in position, with a hand that can flop well. If I miss completely, I can easily fold. If I hit a strong hand (Ace with good kicker, two pair, flush draw, straight draw), I can play aggressively.",

The board is 5s 2d Th.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - best position\n**Stack:** 162 chips (81 BB) - healthy stack\n**Pot:** 10 chips\n**Board:** 5s 2d Th - Rainbow board with no flush draws. Only straight draw possibility is 3-4, but that's unlikely.\n\n**Current situation:** It's just me vs. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who made a small preflop raise to 4 chips (2x BB). I called from the button.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, called a re-raise, checked flop, called 20 on flop, bet 20 on turn\n- Hand 2: Checked preflop (was in BB), checked flop, bet 2 on turn, folded river\n- Hand 3 & 4: Folded preflop\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat active but not overly aggressive. They seem to make small bets and calls. They folded in later hands, suggesting they might be playing tighter now.\n\n**Hand strength:** I have top pair with a good kicker. This is a strong hand on this dry board. There are no flush draws, and only gutshot straight possibilities (34). I'm likely ahead of most of MiniMax-M2's range unless they have:\n- A better Ten (unlikely, I have Ace kicker)\n- An overpair (22, 55 - but 55 would have made a set)\n- 55 or 22 for a set (possible but unlikely)\n- A complete bluff\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 10 chips. I have the option to check or bet.\n\n**Decision:** I should bet for value here. This is a strong hand on a dry board, and I want to extract value from worse hands. A small to medium-sized bet would be appropriate - maybe 5-7 chips (50-70% pot). This allows worse hands to call while building the pot.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 2 chips (which seems like a system quirk - it should be at least 2 chips to bet), I can bet any amount from 2 up to my stack. I'll make a value bet of about 6 chips (60% pot).\n\nLet me make a bet of 6 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I have Ac Ts (Ace of clubs, Ten of spades)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Stack: 156 chips (78 BB)\n- Board: 5s 2d Th 7s\n- Pot: 22 chips\n- Only opponent left: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) with 252 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have top pair (pair of Tens) with Ace kicker\n- Board is relatively dry: 5s 2d Th 7s\n- There are two spades on board (5s, 7s), so a flush draw is possible\n- No obvious straight draws except 3-4-5-6-7 (but I have a Ten, so unlikely)\n- I have a strong hand here - top pair with good kicker\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax raised to 4, I called\n- Flop: I bet 6, MiniMax called\n- Now it's turn, and I can check or bet\n\n**MiniMax-M2's tendencies from recall:**\n- From the 10 actions recalled, MiniMax seems to be a relatively passive player\n- They call and check often, occasionally bet\n- In hand 1, they called flop bet, then bet the turn\n- In hand 2, they checked flop, then bet the turn\n- They folded on river in hand 2\n- They folded preflop in hands 3 and 4\n\n**My recent history:**\n- I've folded all 4 previous hands\n- In hand 1, I raised preflop, bet flop, then folded on turn\n- I need to start winning some pots\n\n**Current situation:**\n- It's checked to me on the turn\n- I have a strong hand (top pair, good kicker)\n- The board has some draws (flush draw)\n- I should bet for value and protection\n\n**Decision:**\nI should bet for value here. My hand is strong but vulnerable to:\n- Flush draws (two spades on board)\n- Straight draws (3-4-5-6-7, though unlikely)\n- Better Tens (KT, QT, JT, T9)\n\nHowever, MiniMax called my flop bet, which suggests they have something. They could have:\n\n\n- A weaker Ten (T9, T8, T7)\n- A pocket pair (99, 88, 66)\n- A flush draw\n- A straight draw\n\nI'll carefully consider the betting strategy. A value bet of around 12-16 chips seems appropriate - large enough to charge draws but not so big that I scare away weaker hands. This sizing allows me to extract value while protecting against potential draws. The goal is to maximize my winnings with this strong but not unbeatable hand.\n\nGiven the pot size of 22 chips and my remaining stack of 150 chips, a 16-chip bet feels like the right balance. It represents about 73% of the pot, which should be compelling enough to get called by weaker hands while still providing decent protection.",

They raised preflop to 4, then just called my flop bet (6) and turn bet (16). This suggests they have something but not a monster hand.\n\n**Pot odds and sizing:**\n- Pot is 54 chips\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 16 (which is the size of my turn bet)\n- My stack is 140 chips, so I have plenty behind\n\n**What could MiniMax-M2 have?**\nGiven the board and their actions:\n- They could have a Q (top pair)\n- They could have a T (same as me)\n- They could have a pocket pair like 88, 99, JJ\n- They could have a flush draw that missed (but only 2 spades on board, so unlikely)\n- They could have a straight draw that missed\n\nSince they just called the turn, they likely don't have a monster like a set or two pair that would have the Q. They might be scared of the Q.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have top pair with a good kicker. Given that MiniMax-M2 has just been calling, I think I have the best hand most of the time. I should value bet here. \n\nThe minimum raise is 16, which would be a reasonable value bet - about 30% of pot. I could bet more, but 16 seems reasonable to get called by worse hands like Tx, 9x, or pocket pairs.\n\nLet me check what bet sizing makes sense. Pot is 54, so a 16 bet is about 30% pot - that's a good value bet size that worse hands might call.\n\nI should bet for value here. My hand is strong enough to bet, and I don't want to give a free showdown to hands that I beat.",

One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, but preflop it doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**To call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Very tight, has folded 5 out of 7 preflop actions. Only called once and folded on turn. Seems very conservative.\n- Seat 3 (BB): More active, has called preflop with some regularity and makes bets on later streets. Seems to defend their blind.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 8-3 offsuit is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n2. **Position**: While button is good, it doesn't compensate for such a weak hand.\n3. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 odds. This is terrible for a hand with such low probability of winning.\n4. **Implied odds**: Very low. Even if we hit something like a pair of 8s, we'll often be dominated.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament with healthy stack. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds often. But Seat 3 (BB) defends their blind regularly, so a steal attempt would be risky.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the pot odds are bad, and one opponent defends their blind. No reason to invest chips here.",

That's 2:2.5 or about 44% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand evaluation**: \n   - Ts4s is a suited hand, so it has some flush potential\n   - However, it's a very weak hand UTG\n   - The \"gap\" between the cards is large (6 ranks apart)\n   - Even if I hit a flush, it could be dominated by higher spade hands\n   - My stack is healthy, so I don't need to take marginal spots\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- Early in a tournament (or at this stack depth), I should be playing tight from early position\n- UTG requires premium hands or at least strong speculative hands\n- Ts4s doesn't qualify as a strong speculative hand due to the low card\n\n**Opponent information**: I don't have any specific reads on these opponents yet since this is only hand #7. Let me check if I can recall any observations about their play patterns.\n\nActually, let me think about whether I should use the recall tools. This is hand #7, so I might have some limited information. Let me check if there are any patterns I should be aware of.\n\nGiven that this is only hand #7, I probably don't have much reliable data yet. The sample size is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about opponent tendencies.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Ts4s is too weak to play from UTG position, even with the suitedness. \n\n- I have no position advantage\n- The hand has poor equity realization\n- I risk getting into trouble post-flop\n- My stack is healthy enough that I don't need to take marginal spots\n- The implied odds aren't great because if I hit a flush, I might not get paid off by better hands, and I could lose a big pot to a higher flush\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

MiniMax-M2 is not overly aggressive preflop\n2. They tend to see flops with marginal hands but are capable of folding\n3. Their preflop raise in hand 5 was to 4 (a min-raise relative to blinds)\n4. Most of their aggression comes post-flop, not preflop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 5h Jd is a very weak hand, offsuit and disconnected\n- Even against a loose opponent, this is a fold-worthy hand\n- However, I have the option to check for free\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- This is a free check situation (no additional chips to see flop)\n- While my hand is weak, checking costs nothing\n- The pot is small (5 chips)\n- MiniMax-M2's range is likely weak given their tendency to fold often\n\n**Tournament Context:**\n- I'm at 96 BB, healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- But checking is risk-free\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nThe hand is weak but checking is completely free. I should check and see the flop. There's no downside to checking, and while 5h Jd is weak, any hand can hit a lucky flop. The opponent's range is also likely weak based on their folding frequency.\n\nI should NOT raise because:\n- My hand is too weak\n- Raising would commit chips with a terrible hand\n- MiniMax-M2 might call or re-raise, putting me in a tough spot\n\nI should NOT fold because:\n- Checking is free\n- No risk involved\n- Could potentially hit a miracle flop (though unlikely)\n\n**Final Decision:** Check",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**1. My hand strength and potential:**\n- I have J5 offsuit (5h Jd)\n- The flop is Js 8d 9c\n- I have top pair with a weak kicker (J5)\n- There are straight draws possible (T-7 makes a straight, Q-T makes a straight)\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (I need a 7 to make a straight)\n\n**2. Position and stack size:**\n- I'm in BB position (out of position)\n- My stack: 192 chips (96 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 is in Seat 4, called preflop from MP position\n\n**3. Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They call preflop frequently (hands 1, 2, 8)\n- They check/call flops often (hands 1, 2, 5)\n- They make small bets on later streets (bets of 2, 4, 6, 20 chips)\n- They fold on rivers sometimes (hands 2, 5)\n- They seem to play a passive, calling style with occasional small bets\n\n**4. Board texture:**\n- Js 8d 9c - Coordinated board with straight draws\n- I have top pair but weak kicker\n- Possible straight draws: T-7, Q-T\n- Possible flush draws: No flush draw yet (one diamond)\n- This is a somewhat dangerous board\n\n**5. Action analysis:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax called 2 chips (limp)\n- I checked in BB\n- On flop, it's checked to me (0 to call)\n- I can check or bet\n\n**Decision:**\nWith top pair weak kicker on a coordinated board, out of position against a passive opponent who likes to call, I should:\n- Bet for value/protection\n- A small to medium bet can get value from weaker Jx hands, 8x, 9x, or draws\n- If I check, I give free cards to draws and lose initiative\n\nGiven the pot is 5 chips, a bet of 3-4 chips (60-80% pot) seems appropriate. This is enough to charge draws but not too big to only get called by better hands.\n\nLet me bet 4 chips (80% pot) to protect my hand and get value.",

Let me think about this hand.\n\nFirst, my hand: 5h Jd. I have a pair of Jacks on the board. The board is Js 8d 9c 4h.\n\nSo I have top pair (Jacks) with a 5 kicker. The board is somewhat coordinated:\n- There are straight possibilities: 7-T, 8-Q, etc.\n- There are flush possibilities: The board has 8d, 9c, 4h - so no flush possible yet, but there are diamonds and hearts and clubs.\n\nLet me think about the action:\n- Preflop: I posted BB, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 2, others folded. I checked my option.\n- Flop: I bet 4 into a pot of ~5 (1+2+2). So I bet ~80% pot. MiniMax called.\n- Turn: The 4h came. Now the board is Js 8d 9c 4h.\n\nThe pot is currently 13 chips (2+2+4+4+1?). Let me recalculate:\n- Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, call 2 = 5 chips\n- Flop: I bet 4, he called 4 = +8, so pot is 13 chips. Yes.\n\nNow it's on me on the turn. I can check or raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total (which would be a min-raise, but that doesn't make sense - wait, the minimum raise TO is 4, meaning I can raise to 4 total, which would be checking? No, that must be a mistake. Usually minimum raise TO would be at least the size of the previous bet. Let me re-read: \"Minimum raise to: 4\". That seems odd. Usually if the last bet was 4, the minimum raise would be to 8 total (another 4). But maybe the system means \"minimum additional amount\" is 4? No, it says \"Minimum raise to: 4\". And \"Amount to call: 0\". So I can check for free, or raise to at least 4 total. That would be a min-bet of 4 chips.\n\nSo my options are:\n- Check\n- Bet (raise to) 4 chips or more\n- Fold (but why would I fold when I can check for free?)\n\nLet me think about my hand strength:\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker (5)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with straight possibilities\n- The turn card (4h) doesn't change much, but it could complete a straight if someone has 5-7 or could make a set if someone has 44\n- The flush draw is not present on the board\n\nI need to consider my opponent's tendencies. Let me look at what I found about MiniMax-M2:\n\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions:\n- Hand 1: Preflop call 8, flop check, flop call 20, turn bet 20\n- Hand 2: Preflop check, flop check, turn bet 2, river fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n- Hand 5: Preflop raise 4, flop call 6, turn call 16, river fold\n- Hand 6: Preflop fold\n- Hand 7"

Let me think through this hand carefully.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have Jd5h and the board is Js 8d 9c 4h\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker\n- The pot is 13 chips\n- I bet 4 on the flop and got called by MiniMax-M2\n- It's now the turn and it's checked to me (amount to call is 0)\n- I can check or bet (minimum bet is 4 chips)\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: Top pair, weak kicker. The board is somewhat coordinated (straight draws possible)\n2. Position: I'm out of position (BB) \n3. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 called my flop bet. From the hand history, they seem to call bets but also fold to pressure sometimes\n4. Pot odds: If I bet, I need to think about what hands would call\n5. Tournament: We're still relatively deep stacked (94 BB)\n\nLet me think about what MiniMax-M2 could have:\n- They called preflop from a non-BB position\n- They called a flop bet on Js 8d 9c\n- Possible hands: Jx (better kicker), 89, 9T, 78, TT, 99, 88, draws\n\nThe turn card is 4h which is largely a blank. It doesn't complete any obvious draws.\n\nShould I bet or check?\n- If I bet, I'm value betting my top pair but also potentially facing a raise from better hands\n- If I check, I give a free card but I also control the pot size with my marginal hand\n\nGiven that I have top pair but a weak kicker, and the board is coordinated, I think checking is the better play. This is a pot control decision. I don't want to build a big pot with a marginal hand, and checking might induce a bluff from worse hands or allow me to see a cheap showdown.\n\nIf I bet:\n- Better hands will call/raise\n- Worse hands might fold\n- I'm not getting value from much worse\n\nIf I check:\n- I induce bluffs\n- I keep the pot small\n- I can call a reasonable river bet\n\nI think checking is the best option here.",

This gives me:\n- One pair of Jacks (top pair)\n- Kicker: 5h (very weak kicker)\n- No flush draw\n- No straight draw currently\n\n**Board Texture:**\nThis is a somewhat dangerous board. There are:\n- Possible straight draws (7-T, 6-7, T-Q)\n- The 8d-9c could create straight possibilities\n- The turn 4h doesn't change much but could complete some draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nLet me look at their betting patterns from the recall data:\n\n1. **Hand 1**: Called preflop, checked flop, called 20 on flop, bet 20 on turn\n2. **Hand 2**: Checked preflop, checked flop, bet 2 on turn, folded river\n3. **Hand 5**: Raised preflop to 4, called 6 on flop, called 16 on turn, folded river\n4. **Hand 8**: Called preflop, bet 4 on flop, checked turn, bet 6 on river\n\nKey observations:\n- They bet small amounts frequently (2, 4, 6, 20)\n- In Hand 1, they bet 20 on turn after calling a big flop bet - suggests strength\n- In Hand 5, they raised preflop, called flop and turn, then folded river - suggests they can continue with marginal hands\n- In Hand 8, they bet flop, checked turn, then bet river - could be probing bets\n\n**Current Hand Dynamics:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped in)\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called 4 (they called my small flop bet)\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4 (small probe bet)\n\nThis betting pattern suggests they could have:\n1. A marginal hand testing if I have something\n2. A draw that they're semi-bluffing\n3. A weak made hand trying to get value\n4. Air trying to steal the pot\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 17\n- Bet: 4\n- Pot odds: 21:4 or 5.25:1\n- I need roughly 16% equity to call profitably\n\n**My Equity:**\nWith just a pair of Jacks with a terrible kicker, my hand is vulnerable. However, given the small bet size and the pot odds, folding seems too weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too weak given pot odds and opponent's small bet size\n2. **Call**: Reasonable - see the river, pot odds are good\n3. **Raise**: Could be an option - I have top pair and the opponent is betting small. A raise could get them to fold better Jacks (like J-T, J-9) or draws.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- I have a weak kicker - if they have a better Jack, I'm behind\n- The board has straight possibilities\n- Their bet is very small (4 into 17), suggesting weakness or a probe\n- I have position (I'm BB, they're in later position)\n- My stack is healthy, so I can afford to play\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWhile this is a cash game format (based on chip stacks), I should still be somewhat protective of my stack, but I'm not in danger.\n\n**Opponent's Turn Bet Pattern:**\nLooking at the recall data, they bet 2 on turn in Hand 2, bet 20 on turn in Hand 1, called 16 on turn in Hand 5. They seem to bet small frequently. This 4-chip bet seems like a weak bet or a probe.\n\n**My Action:**\nI think raising is the best play here. Here's why:\n1. I have top pair and can represent strength\n2. Their small bet suggests weakness\n3. I can get value from draws and weaker pairs\n4. If they have a better Jack, they might just call or fold to a raise\n5. Getting them to fold now would be fine too\n\nIf I raise, the minimum is to 8 (double their bet). I could raise to something like 12-16.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. I have a very weak kicker. If they have J-T, J-9, J-8,"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me reconsider this hand carefully.\n\n**Current Hand Details:**\n- My hand: 5h Jd (pair of Jacks with 5 kicker)\n- Board: Js 8d 9c 4h\n- Pot: 17 chips\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 4 on the turn\n- I need to call 4 to see river\n- Pot odds: 21:4 or 5.25:1\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have top pair (Jacks) but with a terrible kicker (5). The board is somewhat coordinated with straight draws possible (7-T, 6-7, T-Q). There's also a potential flush draw on the flop (8d 9c) but the turn was 4h.\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped)\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called 4\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4\n\nThis betting pattern is interesting. They called my flop bet, which could mean:\n- They have a piece of the flop (pair, draw)\n- They have a marginal hand\n- They have a monster and are slowplaying\n\nWhen I checked the turn, they bet small (4 into 17 pot). This small bet could be:\n- A value bet with a medium strength hand\n- A probe bet with air or a weak hand\n- A blocking bet with a draw\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They bet small amounts frequently (2, 4, 6, 20)\n- They call bets fairly often\n- In Hand 1, they bet 20 on turn after calling a big flop bet (strength)\n- In Hand 5, they raised preflop, called flop and turn, then folded river (can continue with marginal hands)\n- In Hand 8, they bet flop, checked turn, bet river (probing behavior)\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n\n1. **Fold**: Too weak. I'm getting 5.25:1 pot odds and I have top pair. Folding here would be extremely tight.\n\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I can see the river for cheap. However, I'm out of position and will have to face another decision on the river. My hand is vulnerable to many turn and river cards. Also, if they have a better Jack, I'm just throwing away 4 chips.\n\n3. **Raise**: \n   - Pros: I can protect my hand against draws, get value from weaker hands, and potentially take down the pot now. Given their small bet size, a raise could get them to fold better Jacks or marginal hands.\n   - Cons: If they have a better hand (better Jack, two pair, set), I'm building a bigger pot with a dominated hand.\n\n**Key Consideration**: My kicker is terrible. If they have J-T, J-9, J-8, or even J-7, I'm crushed. The board has many cards that could beat me on the river.\n\n**Tournament/Cash Game Context**: I'm deep-stacked (188 chips, 94 BB), so I can afford to play. However, I shouldn't throw away chips unnecessarily.\n\n**Final Decision**: I think the best play is to **call**. Here's why:\n- The pot odds are excellent (5.25:1)\n- Their small bet doesn't necessarily mean strength\n- I have top pair which is often good in this spot\n- I can evaluate the river and make a better decision with more information\n- Raising could isolate me against better hands and build a pot with a marginal holding\n- Folding is too tight given the pot odds\n\nIf the river is a blank (not a T, Q, 7, 6, or card that completes obvious draws), I can consider calling a small bet or checking down. If the river is scary (completes straight, brings flush), I can fold to aggression.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider again. I have position here (I'm BB, they're in MP). When I check the turn and they bet small, this is often a weak hand or a draw. With top pair, I could raise to protect my hand and charge draws. A raise to 12-16 would be appropriate.\n\nBut my kicker is so weak... If I'm raised back, I'm in a terrible spot. If I just call, I keep the pot small and can control the river action.\n\nI think calling is the safest and most profitable play here. Good pot odds, manageable pot size, and I have a made hand.\n\nLet me make the JSON response.",

The board shows:\n- Js 8d 9c 4h 5c\n\nSo my final hand is: J J 5 5 9 (two pair with Jack kicker)\n\n**Pot:** 21 chips\n**My stack:** 184 chips\n**To call:** 0 (I can check)\n**Position:** BB vs Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)\n\nLet me analyze the action:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from CO, I checked my option\n- Flop: I bet 4, they called\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 4, I called\n\nSo we've both shown interest in this pot. The turn bet from them was small (4 into a pot of ~12-13).\n\nNow on the river, I can check or raise. Let me think about what hands MiniMax-M2 might have:\n\nFrom their history, I can see they:\n- Often call and check, sometimes make small bets\n- Have folded on river in hands 2 and 5 after betting on turn\n- Made a river bet in hand 8 for 6 chips\n\nThe board texture:\n- Js 8d 9c 4h 5c - There are straight possibilities (7-6, Q-10, J-7)\n- Flush draws missed (no flush possible)\n- I have two pair\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent two pair hand\n2. The opponent has shown willingness to call and bet small\n3. The pot is 21 chips and I have a strong hand relative to this board\n4. I should try to extract value\n\nI think I should bet for value here. Two pair is likely good, and I want to get called by worse hands like:\n- Top pair (Jx)\n- Second pair (9x)\n- Maybe a straight draw that missed but they might call with\n\nGiven the pot is 21, a bet of around 50-75% pot would be appropriate. The minimum raise is 4, but that's just to enable the raise action - I can bet any amount from 4 up to my stack.\n\nLet me bet around 12-14 chips for value. This is a decent size that worse hands might call.\n\nActually, looking at the action again - on the turn they bet 4 when I checked. This suggests they have something but it's not super strong. A small bet often means a marginal hand or a probe bet.\n\nI think betting about 12-14 chips makes sense. Let me go with 12 (a bit over half pot) to get called by worse.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. The format requires \"raise_to\" to be the TOTAL amount. So if I want to bet 12, I put \"raise_to\": 12.",

The BB is very tight. I have good pot odds (calling 1 to win 3, so 3:1).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 102 BB\n- I can afford to see cheap flops in position\n- This is a good spot to try to steal since BB is tight\n\n**Decision:**\nSince I'm on the button, have position, the BB is very tight (folds 78% of the time), and it only costs me 1 chip to see the flop, I should call. This is a good spot to try to see a cheap flop and potentially steal the pot post-flop if the BB shows weakness.\n\nI could also consider raising to 4 to try to steal right now, but since the BB is tight and only has to call 2 more chips, they might defend with a wide enough range. Calling is better to keep the pot small with a marginal hand.\n\nLet me make the call.",

While I have some backdoor draws, the immediate equity is very low. Betting here would be a bluff. Given that:\n1. The opponent sometimes bets on the flop (hand 6), so they might call or raise a bet\n2. I have position advantage\n3. My hand has very little immediate strength\n4. The pot is small (4 chips)\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I don't have enough equity to bet for value, and a bluff might not be successful given the opponent's tendencies. I can see a free card and potentially improve on the turn.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have position and a healthy stack. The board is 3d 8s 4c - very dry, no high cards. My opponent checked preflop as the BB. They could have a wide range of hands. \n\nA small bet could potentially get them to fold hands that are currently ahead of me (like 6x, 7x, 9x, Tx, etc.) but that didn't connect with this board. However, they might also call with any pair or any draw.\n\nGiven the very weak nature of my hand and the fact that I have position, I think checking to see a free card is the better play. If I improve on the turn (hit a diamond, J, or 5), I can reassess.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. With a backdoor flush draw and gutshot, plus position, a small bet could be profitable as a semi-bluff. The board is very dry, so if they missed, they might fold. But the risk is they could have hit this board in many ways (any pair, any 5-6-7 for straight draws, etc.).\n\nI think the conservative approach is best here. Check and see the turn card.",

The board is 3d 8s 4c Jh.\n- I hit top pair with my Jack (Jh on board)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (one diamond on board, one in my hand)\n- I have a backdoor straight draw (45678 possible, but I only have a 5)\n- My kicker is weak (5)\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- This opponent has been relatively tight preflop (folded many hands)\n- When they do play, they often raise preflop (6 chip raises in hands 6, 7, 8)\n- They tend to be aggressive postflop when they enter (bet 8 on flop in hand 6)\n- They've shown willingness to fold on turn and river\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips)\n- My opponent checked the flop\n- I have top pair weak kicker\n- The board is relatively dry (no flush draws, only straight draws like 56, 57, 67)\n- I'm in position\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. I have a decent made hand (top pair)\n2. The board is somewhat coordinated for straights but not super dangerous\n3. My opponent has shown they can be aggressive but checked twice now\n4. I should likely bet for value and protection\n5. I want to charge any draws or weaker pairs\n6. I need to consider my kicker is weak, so I shouldn't overplay\n\n**Bet Sizing:**\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- Minimum raise is 2 (but that's just a min-bet)\n- I should bet around 50-75% of pot for value\n- A bet of 3-4 chips seems appropriate\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should bet for value here. I have top pair and my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice. I want to extract value from weaker pairs, protect against draws, and take control of the hand. I'll make a value bet of about 3 chips (75% of pot).",

So diamonds are: 3d, Qd, and my Jd is hearts. So only 2 diamonds on board: 3d and Qd. No flush possible.\n- Straight possibilities: 3-4-8-J-Q - no straight possible\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a 5 kicker\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I posted SB (1), opponent posted BB (2), everyone else folded, I called 1 more, opponent checked\n- Flop: I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: I bet 7, opponent called 7\n- River: Opponent checked to me\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at Seat 2's actions across 9 hands:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 6/9 times preflop (67% fold rate)\n- When they enter pots: they sometimes raise (6 chips), sometimes call\n- Postflop behavior: Generally passive - checks often, calls bets, rarely initiates action\n- In hand 6: They raised preflop to 6, bet 8 on flop - this was an aggressive line\n- In hand 8: They raised preflop to 6, called 4 on flop, checked turn, folded river\n- Overall pattern: Tight-passive player who occasionally shows aggression with strong hands\n\n**Current river situation:**\n- Opponent checked to me\n- I have top pair (Jacks)\n- The turn went: I bet 7, opponent called 7\n- Opponent called my turn bet after checking flop\n\n**What does opponent's turn call mean?**\nGiven opponent is tight-passive, their turn call likely means:\n1. They have some piece of the board - maybe a Jack with better kicker, or they hit the Q on river\n2. They could have a pocket pair that improved\n3. They could have been drawing but missed\n4. They rarely bluff given passive pattern\n\n**River decision:**\n- Opponent checked to me - this is often a sign of weakness from a passive player, or a trap with a monster\n- Given opponent is tight-passive, checking likely means either:\n  a) They have a marginal hand and want to see showdown cheaply\n  b) They have a very strong hand and are inducing a bet\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker (5)\n- The board is relatively dry: 3-4-8-J-Q\n- No flushes or straights possible\n- I'm likely ahead of any pocket pairs lower than Jacks, any 8s, 4s, 3s\n- I'm behind any Qx (they have top pair), any Jx with better kicker\n\n**Given the opponent's tight-passive pattern:**\n- They would likely have bet the river if they had a Queen (top pair)\n- They would likely have bet the river if they had a Jack with good kicker\n- Their check suggests either weakness or a slow-played monster\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 196 chips (98 BB) - healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- However, there's 18 in the pot and checking gives a free showdown\n\n**Decision:**\nI should value bet here. The opponent's tight-passive pattern suggests they'll call with worse hands like:\n- Pocket pairs (99, TT)\n- Any 8x, 4x, 3x\n- Maybe even Ace-high if they're sticky\n- They might fold if they have complete air\n\nA small value bet is appropriate. The pot is 18, so a bet of 7-10 chips makes sense.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider that the opponent called my turn bet. What hands would they call turn with?\n- They could have a Jack (but I'd lose to better kickers)\n- They could have a pocket pair\n- They could have picked up a straight draw with 5-6 or 6-7 (but missed)\n- They could have had two overcards\n\nGiven they checked river after calling turn, they likely don't have a Queen. They might have a Jack with marginal kicker.\n\n**Final decision:**\nI should make a thin value bet. Given the pot is 18, a bet of 7-9 chips is appropriate. I'll go with 8 chips"

The opponent's tight-passive pattern suggests they'll call with worse hands like:\n- Pocket pairs (99, TT)\n- Any 8x, 4x, 3x\n- Maybe even Ace-high if they're sticky\n- They might fold if they have complete air\n\nA small value bet is appropriate. The pot is 18, so a bet of 7-10 chips makes sense.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider that the opponent called my turn bet. What hands would they call turn with?\n- They could have a Jack (but I'd lose to better kickers)\n- They could have a pocket pair\n- They could have picked up a straight draw with 5-6 or 6-7 (but missed)\n- They could have had two overcards\n\nGiven they checked river after calling turn, they likely don't have a Queen. They might have a Jack with marginal kicker.\n\n**Final decision:**\nI should make a thin value bet. Given the pot is 18, a bet of 7-9 chips is appropriate. I'll go with 8 chips",

It has almost no potential to make strong hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is advantageous, but it's not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. These are not good enough for a hand this weak.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack of 107 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks. Folding weak hands preserves my stack for better spots.\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies**: The blinds seem to be playing relatively straightforward based on the limited data.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. 7-2 offsuit should be folded in virtually all situations, even on the button. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suited potential\n- No connected potential\n- Very low probability of making a straight or flush\n- Even if I pair one of my cards, I'll likely be outkicked\n\nEven though I'm on the button with good position, the hand is just too weak to justify even a 2-chip call. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Details:**\n- My position: BTN (Button) - Seat 1\n- My cards: 2h As (Ace of spades, 2 of hearts)\n- My stack: 212 chips (106 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 4 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted SB (1 chip)\n- I posted BB (2 chips)\n- Seats 2, 3, 4 all folded\n- Seat 5 called the additional 1 chip to match the BB\n\nSo now it's back to me on the Button (which is also the BB position in this case since everyone else folded). I can check or raise.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n- In hand 13, they called preflop, then checked flop and turn, then folded on turn\n\nThis suggests they're a conservative player who doesn't play many hands. Their call here likely indicates some hand strength, but not a premium hand (since they didn't raise).\n\n**My Hand:**\nI have A2 offsuit. This is a marginal hand:\n- Pros: I have an Ace, which is good. Position on the button.\n- Cons: Weak kicker (2). Offsuit. In a heads-up situation, Ace-rag can be problematic if an Ace hits and they have a better kicker.\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n- It's heads-up (me vs Seat 5)\n- I'm in position (acting last postflop)\n- Pot is small (4 chips)\n- I have a strong stack (212 chips)\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Marginal. A2o is not great, but it's heads-up and I have position.\n2. **Position**: Excellent. I'm on the button, so I act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight player who just called. They likely have a decent hand but not premium.\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 4, it costs me 0 to check. Checking is free.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks, but also no pressure.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: See a free flop with my A2o. This is low risk. I have position and can evaluate postflop.\n- **Raise**: Try to take down the pot now. However, against a tight player who called, a raise might only get called by better hands. Minimum raise to 4 would be a 2 chip raise.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI should check here. Here's why:\n- My hand is marginal and I can see a free flop\n- I have position, which is valuable postflop\n- The opponent is tight - if I raise, I'll likely only get action from better hands\n- The pot is small, so there's no urgency to protect or build it\n- I can evaluate postflop based on board texture and opponent's action\n\nChecking keeps the pot small with my marginal hand while maintaining the advantage of position. If I hit an Ace on the flop, I need to be cautious about my kicker. If I hit a 2, I'll have a pair but it's a low pair.\n\nLet me formulate the JSON response.",

They rarely enter pots, and when they do, they play passively. The fact that they're betting on the flop here suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 10, I need to call 6\n- Pot odds: 16:6 or about 2.67:1\n- This means I need ~27% equity to call\n\n**Board Texture:**\n- Very dangerous board with K-Q-9\n- Many possible strong hands: KQ, K9, Q9, sets, two pairs\n- Possible straight draws (JT)\n- I have no draw and no pair\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the button, which is good position\n- But without any hand strength or draws, position doesn't help much here\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. I only have Ace-high with no draw\n2. The board is highly coordinated and dangerous\n3. Opponent is very tight and is betting into me (indicating strength)\n4. I need to call 6 chips with very little chance of winning\n5. Even if I hit an Ace on turn or river, I could still be behind to many hands\n\nI should fold. Calling here would be throwing away chips with a very weak hand against a tight opponent showing strength.

My hand: 5h 6d - This is a weak suited connector (not suited, actually offsuit). 5-6 offsuit is a very marginal hand, especially from the button.\n\n2. Position: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This gives me advantage.\n\n3. Stack size: I have 211 chips (105.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. Pot odds: Only 1 chip to call to win 3 chips (getting 3:1 odds).\n\n5. Opponent tendencies: Looking at Kimi-K2's actions from the recall:\n   - Very tight player - folds preflop frequently (hands 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14)\n   - When they do enter pots, they often raise to 6 (hands 6, 7, 8, 12)\n   - They play straightforward post-flop (bet flop, then check/fold turn/river in hand 8)\n   - They called a turn bet in hand 10 but folded river\n\n6. Tournament considerations: With a healthy stack of 105 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should be looking for better opportunities.\n\n7. The action: Everyone folded to me on the button. I can complete the blind for 1 chip or raise.\n\nAnalysis:\n- 5-6 offsuit is a very weak hand that will rarely make strong hands\n- Even though I'm getting good pot odds (3:1), the hand has poor equity against any reasonable BB defending range\n- The BB (Kimi-K2) is tight and will likely defend with better hands\n- From the button, I could consider a steal raise, but against a tight player who folds a lot preflop, this might work\n- However, if called, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position post-flop (the BB will have position on me)\n- My hand has very little showdown value and poor playability\n\nThe best play here is to fold. While the pot odds are tempting, 5-6 offsuit is just too weak to play profitably, even from the button. I should wait for better spots with my healthy stack.",

Recent actions show they fold a lot preflop (hands 9, 11, 13, 14, 15) but they did raise to 6 in hand 12. They seem tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): BB position, 222 chips. Very tight - has folded preflop in 8 out of 10 recent actions. Only raised once (hand 13) and showed aggression post-flop in that hand.\n\n**My recent play:** I've been very tight, folding 12 out of 15 hands. This means I likely have a tight image.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket 8s is a strong hand, especially from the button. It's vulnerable to overcards but has good potential.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents:** Both opponents seem tight. The SB folds a lot, and the BB is extremely tight.\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 105.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips.\n5. **Pot odds:** Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is fine for pocket 8s.\n\n**Decision:** With a medium pocket pair on the button against two tight opponents, I should definitely play this hand. I have two options:\n\n- **Call (2 chips):** Play cautiously, see the flop. Risk is low, but I give the BB a chance to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n- **Raise:** Take control of the hand. A standard raise would be 3x-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips.\n\nGiven that both opponents are tight and I have a tight image, a raise makes sense. It:\n1. Builds the pot when I likely have the best hand\n2. Gets value from hands that might call (like Ax, Kx, Qx, smaller pairs)\n3. Takes control of the hand\n4. Capitalizes on my tight image\n\nA raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. Let me go with 6 chips (3x BB) as it's the standard size and keeps my risk manageable.\n\n**Final decision:** Raise to 6 chips.",

It's simply not a profitable hand to play from this position.

Hand strength: K4o is a weak hand, but the King has some value. In position on the button, this is a borderline hand.\n2. Position: BTN is the best position - I get to act last postflop\n3. Opponent: Very tight player in BB, likely has a strong range when they defend\n4. Pot odds: 3:1 to call, which is good\n5. Tournament: Stack is healthy, can afford to see flops in position\n\nWith a tight opponent in the BB, I could try to steal with a raise. However, since they're tight, they might only call/raise with strong hands. \n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too tight, I have position and good pot odds\n- Call: Cheap to see flop in position, but hand is weak\n- Raise: Steal attempt. Min raise is to 4. Could raise to 5-6.\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness (folding 80% preflop), a steal attempt seems profitable. If they call, I have position. If they re-raise, I can fold easily.\n\nI think a small raise to 5 or 6 chips is the best play here. It's a good stealing spot against a tight BB defender.",

Ten-high with a terrible kicker (2c).\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Good position, but doesn't make up for the terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 220 chips (55 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: It's folded to me on the button. SB and BB are the only players left.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 13, 14, 16, 18, 19). Called in hands 17 and 20. Raised once in hand 12. Seems relatively tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Very tight! Folded preflop in hands 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. That's 7 consecutive folds! Only played hand 13 where they reached showdown with Q3s. This player is extremely tight.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. I don't have that with T2o.\n\n**Decision**: Even though I'm on the button and the blinds seem tight (especially BB who folds 87.5% of the time based on recent data), T2o is just too weak to play. The SB could defend, and even if they both fold often, the times they don't I'll be in bad shape.\n\nI should fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot. It's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, no need to get involved with such a weak holding.\n\n**Action**: Fold",

It's not connected, not suited, and has poor playability post-flop. This is typically a fold from early position.\n\n**Position considerations:**\nUTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act post-flop. This means I have no information about opponents' intentions and could face multiple raises behind me.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nLooking at the opponent data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I see:\n- Mostly folds preflop (5 out of 7 hands)\n- Occasionally calls (2 out of 7 hands)\n- Recently raised to 12 chips in hands 21 and 22\n- Seems to be playing relatively tight\n\n**My recent play:**\nLooking at my last 5 hands:\n- Hand 18: UTG with Th 9s - folded preflop\n- Hand 19: BB with Ks 5d - won (likely everyone folded)\n- Hand 20: SB with 4c Kd - won with trips (hit miracle flop)\n- Hand 21: BTN with 2c Th - folded preflop\n- Hand 22: CO with 4h Qs - folded preflop\n\nI've been playing relatively tight, which is good.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (55 BB)\n- Blinds are 2/4, so I can afford to be patient\n- No need to risk chips with marginal hands from bad position\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 8J offsuit from UTG is not a profitable hand, especially with a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe minimum raise to 8 chips would be a bad idea - it's too small to fold out opponents and I'd be playing a weak hand out of position. Calling 4 chips would also be unprofitable with this hand from UTG.\n\n**Final decision: FOLD**",

Seems tight/passive. When they do play, they make small bets (2 chips on turn/river in hand 18).\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also very tight preflop, folding most hands (19-22), only played hand 23 where they checked and then bet 4 on turn. Made a small raise here.\n\n**Pot odds**: Calling 4 to win 16 = 4:1 odds, which is good for a speculative hand like TJo.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. TJo offsuit is marginal, especially OOP\n2. I'm getting good immediate pot odds\n3. Both opponents seem tight/passive\n4. If I hit a strong hand, I can likely get value from these passive players\n5. My stack is healthy enough to take a speculative call\n6. I'm out of position which is a disadvantage\n\n**Decision**: Calling seems reasonable here. The raise is small (min-raise), I'm getting good odds, and the opponents seem passive enough that I won't face difficult pressure postflop. I don't want to 3-bet with TJo OOP against two players, and folding seems too tight given the price.\n\nLet me call.",

The board is Qs Th 2d 5s. \n- Possible hands that beat me: Any queen (top pair), any two pair, sets, straights (unlikely with this board)\n- I have 4 outs to two pair (any jack), giving me ~8% equity\n- The board is relatively dry with no flush draws and only possible straight draws (KJ, J9, 43)\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall:\n- **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB):** Has been relatively passive, but is now betting aggressively. They raised preflop, bet flop, and now bet 50 on turn. This suggests they have a strong hand. They've shown aggression before but not consistently.\n\n- **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):** Has been folding a lot preflop. Called preflop, called flop, but hasn't shown much aggression. They called flop bet of 20 which could mean they have something but not super strong.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 134, I need to call 50.\nPot odds = 134:50 or 2.68:1\nI need ~27% equity to call profitably.\n\nI only have ~8% equity with my 4 outs to two pair. This is not enough to call based on pot odds alone.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 192 chips left. If I call 50, I'll have 142 left. If I raise, minimum is 100 which puts a lot of pressure on my stack.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. I only have middle pair with weak kicker\n2. GPT-OSS-120B is showing significant aggression (raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn)\n\n\n3. I don't have enough pot odds to call\n4. My hand has very limited improvement potential\n5. Raising would be a semi-bluff at best, but would commit too much of my stack\n\nI'll fold this hand.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: Ah 9s (Ace of hearts, 9 of spades) - decent hand, Ace-high\n- Stack: 190 chips (47.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n- Min raise: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nLooking at the opponent actions, I can see:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24)\n- When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 12, 21, 22)\n- They made a big raise to 12 in hands 21 and 22\n- In hand 22 they also bet 20 on the flop\n- They seem to be playing somewhat tight-aggressive when they do enter pots\n\n**My Recent History:**\n- I've been playing fairly tight (18 folds out of 24 hands)\n- I've had some success with raises (won with 88 in hand 16, won with 44 in hand 20)\n- Last hand (24) I called preflop with Td Jc and called a flop bet before folding on turn\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: A9o is a decent but not premium hand. It's good enough to play from the button.\n2. **Position**: Button is the best position - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: The BB seems to fold a lot preflop, so there's fold equity.\n4. **Pot Odds**: Calling 2 to win 6 = 3:1 pot odds, which is good for A9.\n5. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy 47.5 BB, can afford to play this hand.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from the button with A9o. This would be overly cautious.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. I see a flop in position with a decent hand. Risk is small (2 chips).\n- **Raise**: Also reasonable. I have fold equity against a tight opponent, and I can take control of the hand. Min raise is 8 chips.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button, have a tight image, and the opponent folds a lot preflop, I think a raise is the best play. It gives me fold equity, and if called, I have position and a hand that can hit strong top pairs.\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips, but the minimum is 8. I should raise to at least 12 to make it a real raise. Given my stack and the opponent's tendency to fold, I could even go to 14-16.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x BB), which is a standard size and puts pressure on the tight BB.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah 9s - Ace-nine offsuit. This is a decent but not great hand, especially in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: I have 180 chips (45 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - I raised to 12 from the button (3x BB standard raise)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) re-raised to 32 (a 3-bet)\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 20 chips (I already invested 12, need to add 20 more to call 32 total)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: There's 44 in the pot + my 12 + their 32 = 88 chips. I need to call 20, so getting 88:20 or about 4.4:1 odds.\n\n7. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding preflop many times\n   - They've made some raises (hands 12, 21, 22) \n   - In hand 22, they raised preflop to 12 and then bet 20 on the flop, showing aggression\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly - when they raise, they likely have a strong hand\n   - No showdown data available\n\n8. **Hand strength**: A9o is marginal against a 3-bet. Against a typical 3-betting range (JJ+, AQ+, maybe some bluffs), A9o is in bad shape. Even if they're 3-betting lighter, I'm dominated by many hands (AT+, AJ+, AQ+, AK).\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: With 45 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can wait for better opportunities. Calling here would put 32 chips in the pot (18% of my stack) with a marginal hand out of position for my opponent postflop (they'll be acting first).\n\n10. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. A9o is too weak to call a 3-bet, even with position. The opponent's raise to 32 suggests strength, and I don't have the pot odds or implied odds to justify calling with this hand. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Ah Tc (Ace of hearts, Ten of clubs)\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n**Stack**: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n**Blinds**: 2/4\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**To call**: 4 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ah Tc is a decent hand but it's offsuit and from early position, it's marginal. This is typically a fold from UTG in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players behind me who can act. If I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by better hands.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have a decent stack at 46.5 BB, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Recent Opponent Behavior** (from the recall):\n   - MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB) has been calling raises and playing post-flop (called 8 preflop, called 20 and 50 on flop/turn in hand 24)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been aggressive (raised to 8 preflop in hand 24, then bet 20 and 50 on flop/turn)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3, SB) has been folding a lot\n   - Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been folding and raising occasionally\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 46.5 BB, I'm in decent shape. Playing marginal hands from early position is a recipe for losing chips unnecessarily.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1 odds. That's not particularly relevant here since it's just the big blind.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold from UTG. Ah Tc is too weak to open from early position. If I raise, I'm likely to get action from better hands. If I call, I'm playing a marginal hand out of position against multiple opponents. The best play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThis is especially true given that MiniMax-M2 in the BB seems to defend their blind and play post-flop, so if I raise, I'm likely to get called and play a big pot out of position with a marginal hand.",

It has:\n- No high card value\n- Not suited\n- Not connected (gap of 4)\n- Very low chance of making a straight or flush\n- Even if you hit a pair, it's a weak pair\n\n**Position Analysis:**\nUTG is the worst position - you have to act first on every street, giving opponents maximum information about your hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Very tight, folding most hands preflop (8 folds out of 10 actions)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Mixed, some calls and folds, played a hand to showdown in hand 24\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): More aggressive, has raised preflop and bet postflop, but also folds sometimes\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- With 46.5 BB, I'm in decent shape but not deep stacked\n- This is a tournament, so chip preservation is important\n- From UTG, I need a very strong hand to play\n- Calling 4 chips to win 6 chips means I need 40% equity, which 84o doesn't have against any reasonable range\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 84 offsuit from UTG is unplayable even in a loose cash game, and especially in a tournament where you want to preserve your chips for better spots. The hand has almost no post-flop playability and you're out of position.\n\nThe only consideration might be if the table is extremely passive and I could see a cheap flop, but even then, 84o is just too weak to justify putting chips in from UTG.",

My hand is terrible, I'm out of position, the original raiser is showing extreme strength, and I have no need to gamble with 45.5 BB. The implied odds are poor because even if I hit my hand, I'm unlikely to get paid off significantly, and I could be dominated.\n\nEven though the pot odds are 3.2:1, with such a weak hand and facing a likely premium hand from DeepSeek, I should fold.",

My hand is too weak, I'm out of position, facing a tight player's raise, and the pot odds don't justify a call. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

Seems to be playing a wide range.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 - BB):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Extremely tight/foldy preflop: folded in hands 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30\n- Only raised once: hand 29 to 16 chips\n- In hand 29: raised preflop, bet 25 on flop, then gave up (checked turn and river)\n- Showdowns: Qd 3d (weak hand), Ks Ah (strong hand)\n- Pattern: Very tight preflop, only plays premium hands. When they do play, they're aggressive postflop.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n\n**My Hand: J\u2665 3\u2663**\n- This is a trash hand. Offsuite, low kicker, no connectivity.\n- On the button, I could theoretically steal blinds, but...\n- SB is aggressive and likely to defend or re-raise\n- BB is very tight and will only continue with premium hands\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Getting 1.5:1 pot odds\n- Need 40% equity to call profitably\n\n**Equity Analysis:**\n- J3o has about 35-40% equity against random hands\n- Against SB's wide range: maybe 40-45%\n- Against BB's tight range: maybe 25-30%\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm in decent shape with 45 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Preserve stack for better opportunities\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak (J3o)\n2. **Position**: On button is good, but...\n3. **Opponents**: SB is aggressive, BB is very tight\n4. **Pot odds**: Marginal at best\n5. **Stack preservation**: Important\n\n**Strategic Options:**\n\n**Option 1: Fold**\n- Safest play\n- Preserve 180 chip stack\n- Wait for better hand\n- No risk involved\n\n**Option 2: Call (4 chips)**\n- Pot odds are marginal\n- Could see flop and try to hit something\n- But with J3o, hitting the flop is unlikely\n- Even if I hit a J, I'm often dominated by better kickers\n- If I hit a 3, it's unlikely to be good\n- Postflop playability is terrible\n\n**Option 3: Raise (steal attempt)**\n- On button, raising to 8-12 chips could steal blinds\n- But SB is aggressive and likely to defend or re-raise\n- BB is tight and will fold anything but premium hands\n- Risk: If SB re-raises, I'm forced to fold and lose chips\n- If SB calls, I'm out of position postflop with trash hand\n\n**Best Decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis, **folding is the clear best option**:\n- My hand is trash (J3o)\n- SB is aggressive and likely to defend\n- BB is tight and will only continue with hands that crush me\n- No need to risk chips with marginal hand\n- Preserve stack for better spots\n\nThe pot odds aren't compelling enough to call with such a weak hand, and a steal attempt is risky against an aggressive SB who has shown willingness to raise preflop.\n\n**Final Decision: Fold**",

Let me think about this hand:\n\n**Hand Analysis: 6d Qd from UTG**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q6 suited is a very weak hand. Even suited, this is a fold from early position in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position post-flop. This means I'll be out of position against everyone.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 180 chips (45 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted SB - aggressive or just standard?\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB - will defend their blind\n   - No specific reads on these opponents\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 45 BB, I should be playing tight from early position. Q6 suited is simply not strong enough to play from UTG.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have to call 4 chips to win 6. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not relevant here since my hand is too weak.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. Q6 suited is a trash hand from UTG. I should preserve my chips for better spots. The suitedness gives some potential but not enough to overcome the positional disadvantage and hand weakness.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 9s Td (9 of spades, 10 of diamonds) - This is a marginal hand, suited but not connected. It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights or pairs.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is good position post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 176 chips (44 BB) - This is a healthy stack size.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot is 10 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) called the 4 chip big blind\n- Everyone else folded\n- It's back to me in BB with no additional amount to call (I already posted the BB)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLet me look at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data I retrieved:\n- In hand 29: Called 25 on flop, then checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 30: Folded preflop\n- Hand 31: Folded preflop\n- Hand 32: Called 8 preflop, then bet 20 on flop (aggressive post-flop)\n- Hand 33: Called 2 preflop (SB), checked flop, bet 4 on turn\n\nFrom this pattern:\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop with a fairly wide range (called in 3 out of 4 hands where they entered)\n- They can be aggressive post-flop (hand 32 they bet 20 on flop)\n- They also show some passive tendencies (hand 29 they checked down)\n- Overall, they seem like a moderately active player\n\n**Pot odds:** There's 10 chips in the pot and I can check for free, so I'm getting infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n\n**Hand equity:** With 9s Td, I have about 45-50% equity against a typical calling range from that position. Since I can see the flop for free, checking is definitely profitable.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. **Checking:** This is the safe play. I get to see a free flop with a marginal hand. If I hit something strong (pair+good kicker, straight draw, flush draw), I can proceed. If I miss completely, I can fold with minimal loss.\n \nI'll consider raising as a strategic option to apply pressure. MiniMax-M2 has shown some vulnerability, folding multiple preflop hands. A raise could potentially win the pot immediately or put me in a stronger position post-flop. However, my hand's strength is marginal, which makes this a higher-risk play. The key is balancing potential aggression with the limitations of my current hand.\n\nThe optimal move seems to be a conservative check. I'll see the flop without investing additional chips, allowing me to assess the board's potential and make a more informed decision based on the community cards.\n\nChecking provides maximum flexibility with minimal risk, perfectly aligning with my current strategic approach.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 9s Td (I have two pair - tens and nines)\n- Board: Th 9h 7h 2h (four hearts on board)\n- Pot: 26 chips\n- My stack: 168 chips (42 BB)\n- Position: BB\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 116 chips\n\n**Board analysis:**\nThe board shows 4 hearts (Th, 9h, 7h, 2h). This is a very dangerous board for me because:\n1. I only have the 9s, so any heart beats my two pair\n2. The Th is on board, so someone could have AhXh, KhXh, QhXh, JhXh\n3. Someone could also have a straight flush draw with 8h6h\n\n**My hand:** Two pair (tens and nines). This is strong on a non-flush board, but very vulnerable here.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from seat 4\n- Flop: I bet 8, MiniMax-M2 called 8\n- Turn: It's on me to act, I can check\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They call preflop frequently (hands 27, 29, 32, 33)\n- They check-call on flop/turn (hand 27, 29)\n- They sometimes lead bet (hand 32 flop bet 20, hand 33 turn bet 4)\n- They haven't shown any big aggression patterns\n- They seem to be a calling station type who likes to see cards\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: My two pair is likely beating any non-flush hand, but loses to any heart. Given the 4 hearts on board, the probability opponent has at least one heart is high.\n\n2. **Board texture**: Extremely dangerous with 4 hearts. Anyone with any heart has a flush.\n\n3. **Pot size**: 26 chips is relatively small compared to stacks.\n\n4. **Opponent's action**: They called my flop bet. This could mean:\n   - They have a flush and are trapping\n   - They have a strong hand like a set or two pair\n   - They have a draw (straight draw, or one heart hoping for a flush)\n   - They have top pair or medium pair\n\n5. **My position**: I'm out of position which is bad for hand reading.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 168 chips, opponent has 116. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot.\n\n**The key question**: Should I check or bet?\n\nIf I bet:\n- A flush will likely raise me\n- A draw might call\n- A weaker hand might fold\n- I'm building a pot with a vulnerable hand\n\nIf I check:\n- I can see a free river card\n- If opponent bets, I have a tough decision but can fold if the bet is large\n- I keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n\nGiven that there are 4 hearts on board and I have none, the probability my opponent has at least one heart is significant. In fact, with 4 hearts on board, any random hand has a ~19% chance of containing at least one heart (9 hearts left in deck, 44 unknown cards).\n\nBut more importantly, the fact that they called my flop bet on a 3-heart board suggests they might have had a flush draw or already had a flush.\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. This is a clear check/fold situation if facing significant aggression. My hand is too vulnerable, and I don't want to build a big pot with just two pair when 4 hearts are out there. I should check and see what opponent does, ready to fold to any substantial bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have TWO PAIR with Tens and Nines. The board is Th 9h 7h 2h. So I have top two pair. But any heart beats me.\n\nWait, I need to think about the opponent's range more carefully. What hands would call preflop and then call a flop bet on a 3-heart board?\n- Any heart (flush draw)\n- Sets (77, 99, TT)\n- Two pair (T9, T7, 97)\n- Top pair with good kicker\n- Straight draws (86, J8)\n\nGiven the opponent is a calling station based on their history, they could have a wide range.\n\nBut with 4 hearts now on board, if they have ANY heart, they have a flush. That's extremely likely given they called on the flop when there were 3 hearts.\n\nThe fact that I have the Th on board means the Ah, Kh, Qh, Jh are all potentially in their hand.\n\nI think checking is"

My two pair is vulnerable to:\n- Any heart (flush)\n- Any J or 8 (straight)\n- Any T (better two pair)\n- Any 9 (better two pair with higher kicker)\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2 - Seat 4):**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 shows these patterns:\n- Often calls preflop (hands 27, 29, 32, 33)\n- Has shown down with hands like As7s, Ac8d, AcJh - seems to play suited Aces and some broadway cards\n- In hand 32, they bet 20 on flop after calling preflop\n- In hand 33, they bet 4 on turn\n- Generally seems to be a straightforward player who bets when they have something\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: They called 4\n- Flop: I bet 8, they called 8 (board: Th 9h 7h)\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 8 (board: Th 9h 7h 2h)\n\nThe turn card is 2h, completing the flush draw. Their bet of 8 into a pot of 26 is about 31% pot.\n\n**My Decision:**\nI'm facing 8 to call in a pot of 34 (about 24% pot odds).\n\nMy hand is two pair, but I'm very vulnerable. The opponent's pattern suggests they likely have:\n1. A made flush (any heart)\n2. A straight (with J8)\n3. A set or better two pair\n4. Possibly a bluff or semi-bluff with one heart trying to push me off\n\nGiven that they called the flop bet on a very wet board (Th 9h 7h), they likely have something. The turn bet after I checked suggests strength.\n\nWith my stack of 168 chips, I have plenty of chips to fold and wait for better spots. This is a tournament where chip preservation is important. Calling here would be marginal at best, and I could lose a significant portion of my stack.\n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for a better situation.",

Not great for a pair that needs to hit a set to be confident.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 41.5 BB, we have room to play. Set mining is possible, but we need good implied odds.\n\n**Opponent read**: GPT-OSS-120B seems tight, so their raise range is probably strong. They might have higher pairs or big cards that dominate us.\n\nGiven our position and the opponent's tight image, I think this is a fold. We're out of position with a medium pair against what appears to be a tight player. The pot odds aren't great for set mining (we'd need ~10:1 implied odds typically), and being first to act post-flop multiplies our disadvantage.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc 7s (Queen of clubs, 7 of spades) - This is a mediocre hand. It's offsuit and not connected. Q7o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, the best at the table. Being on the button means I act last postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 166 chips (41.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack, not short-stacked yet.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Players left:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 222 chips (55.5 BB)\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 198 chips (49.5 BB)\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\n\nKimi-K2 (Seat 2/SB):\n- Recent pattern shows mostly folding preflop (folded in hands 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35)\n- Has raised preflop a couple times (hand 28: raised to 16, hand 32: raised to 12)\n- In hand 32, raised preflop to 12 but folded on the flop\n- Showdown hand 27 with K9s - seems to play some speculative hands\n- Overall: Relatively tight, folds frequently, but capable of raising\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3/BB):\n- Very tight pattern - has folded preflop in hands 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35\n- Only showed aggression in hand 29: raised preflop to 16, then bet 25 on flop, checked turn and river\n- Showdown hand 29 with AKs - strong hand\n- Showdown hand 13 with Q3s - questionable hand selection\n- Overall: Very tight, folds most hands, only plays strong hands aggressively\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Q7o is weak. I should fold this most of the time.\n\n\n2. **Positional advantage offers minimal value with such a weak hand. The potential to steal blinds exists, but opponents' tendencies suggest caution. Button position can't compensate for poor card quality.**\n\n3. **Opponent behaviors reveal tight playing styles. Both players frequently fold, indicating potential for strategic aggression. However, their tightness suggests they'll only engage with strong hands.**\n\n4. **Stealing risk assessment shows moderate potential. Small blind and big blind have demonstrated willingness to fold, but could defend unexpectedly.**\n\n5. **Stack preservation becomes crucial. With 41.5 BB, maintaining chip integrity is more valuable than marginal blind-stealing attempts.**\n\n6. **Tournament strategy emphasizes survival and strategic chip accumulation. Risking chips on weak hands contradicts long-term tournament success principles.**\n\n7. **Alternative approach recommends conservative play: fold the hand, observe opponent reactions, and wait for more favorable opportunities.",

This raise to 8 seems unusual for them.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mixes between folding and raising to 8. They've raised to 8 in hands 35 and 38, and called here. In hand 38, they checked down and made a small river bet.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 3d 4d is a low suited connector\n- Very weak hand that rarely makes strong holdings\n- Even when it hits, it's often dominated\n- From SB, this is a clear fold in most situations\n\n**Position:**\n- In SB, we're out of position for the entire hand\n- This makes it harder to realize equity\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 6 to win 22 (3.67:1)\n- This might seem reasonable, but with this hand from this position, it's not enough\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have 41.5 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 34s from SB facing a raise and a call is not a profitable play. We're out of position with a weak hand that rarely makes the nuts. Even though the price seems okay, the combination of hand strength, position, and tournament considerations makes this an easy fold.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2 is suspicious given their tight history, but that doesn't make 34s good enough to call.

That's pot odds of 12:8 or 1.5:1. I need 40% equity to justify a call.\n\nWith 93o against random hands, I have about 35-40% equity, but:\n1. The SB has shown they can raise with decent hands\n2. The BB has been extremely tight, folding everything recently\n3. My hand has almost no playability postflop - no suitedness, no connectivity, low cards\n4. Even if I hit a 9, I'm often dominated by better 9s\n5. If I hit a 3, it's almost never good\n\nGiven the BB's extreme tightness (folding 10 hands in a row), there's a chance they might defend their blind here, but it's unlikely. The SB could have a wide range but has shown they can raise.\n\nWith my weak hand and the need to preserve my 20BB stack in a tournament, this is a clear fold. The position advantage doesn't compensate for such a weak holding. I should wait for better spots, especially given that I have enough chips to be patient.\n\nI could consider a steal raise since the BB is so tight, but:\n- The SB has shown they can raise/call\n- 93o is too weak to raise with\n- If I raise and get called, I'll be in a tough spot postflop\n- My stack isn't deep enough to make speculative plays like this profitable\n\nDecision: FOLD",

J4 offsuit is not a good starting hand, especially from early position.\n\n**Position**: CO (Cutoff) - This is a good position, but my hand is too weak to play profitably.\n\n**Stack**: 166 chips (20.8 BB) - I'm in decent shape stack-wise, not desperate.\n\n**Current action**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24 (3x the big blind)\n- I need to call 24 to continue\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 36, I need to call 24, so I'm getting 36:24 or 1.5:1 odds.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at the search results for GPT-OSS-120B:\n- Hand 32: Folded preflop from CO\n- Hand 33: Checked BB, folded on turn after opponent bet\n- Hand 34: Folded preflop from BTN\n- Hand 35: Raised to 8 from SB (3x BB), everyone folded\n- Hand 36: Folded preflop from UTG\n- Hand 37: Folded preflop from MP\n- Hand 38: Raised to 8 from BB, checked down, bet 4 on river and won\n- Hand 40: Called 8 from BB, called 11 on flop, checked down\n- Hand 41: Folded preflop from SB\n\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be a somewhat tight player who raises with strong hands. Their raise to 24 (3x BB) from early position suggests a strong hand.\n\n**Decision**: With Js 4d, I have:\n- Very weak hand that is easily dominated\n- No suited connectors\n- No potential for straight or flush\n- Even if I hit a Jack, I could be dominated by better Jacks\n- The opponent's raise suggests strength\n\nI should fold this hand. Calling 24 chips (3 BB) with J4 offsuit is a losing play long-term. I don't have the pot odds to justify calling, and I'm not getting good implied odds with this hand. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other tools I should use... I could look at my own hands to see patterns, but the decision seems clear.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- They raise from SB position (hand 42) - 3x raise to 24\n- They call preflop raises (hands 40, 43)\n- They seem to play relatively straightforward postflop with check/call patterns\n- They've shown aggression from SB before\n\nI have pocket Jacks (Jd Js) - this is a premium hand, especially with only one opponent left. I'm on the Button which is great position.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Blinds 4/8\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- I need to call 8 more\n- Minimum raise to 24 (which is 3x the big blind)\n- Stack: 158 chips (19.8 BB)\n\nWith pocket Jacks heads-up against SB's raise:\n1. Hand strength: Very strong heads-up, but vulnerable to overcards\n2. Position: Button - best position\n3. Stack: 19.8 BB - tournament stack, need to be careful but can play aggressively\n4. Opponent: Has raised from SB before (hand 42), seems capable of aggression\n\nI should definitely not fold. The question is call or raise.\n\nCalling pros:\n- See flop cheaply\n- Keep pot smaller if overcards come\n\nCalling cons:\n- Let opponent see flop cheaply with any two cards\n- Give them control\n- Miss value\n\nRaising pros:\n- Extract value from weaker hands\n- Define opponent's range\n- Take control of hand\n- Charge them to see overcards\n\nRaising cons:\n- If they have a monster (AA, KK, QQ), could lose big\n- Risk of getting 3-bet all-in\n\nGiven I have position and a strong hand, I should raise. A standard 3-bet would be to about 3x their raise, so around 48-50 chips. Let me calculate:\n- They raised to 16 (which is 2x the BB)\n- A 3x re-raise would be to 48 chips\n- This is about 30% of my stack, which is reasonable\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the raise sizing:\n- SB posted 4\n- They raised 16 (so total 16 to match)\n- The minimum raise to is 24, which means I need to make it 24 total to call\n- Wait, let me recalculate: They raised to 16, which means they put in 12 more than their SB (4+12=16)\n- To raise, minimum would be 16 + (16-4) = 28? No, the system says minimum raise to 24\n\nLet me think about this differently. The system says:\n- Amount to call: 8 (so I need to put in 8 more to match their 16)\n- Minimum raise to: 24\n\nSo if I raise to 24 total, that means I'm raising by 8 over their 16. That's a min-raise, which is weak.\n\nA better sizing would be 3x their raise: 16 * 3 = 48. Or maybe 2.5x: 40.\n\nGiven my stack is 158, raising to 48 (about 30% of stack) is reasonable. It builds the pot with my premium hand and extracts value.\n\nLet me make a standard 3-bet to 48 chips.",

In any position, this is a fold preflop.\n\n2. **My position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is the worst position at the table (second to act preflop but first to act postflop).\n\n3. **My stack**: 178 chips (22.2 BB) - This is a decent stack size, but not so deep that I can afford to bleed chips.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Blinds: 4/8\n   - I've already posted 4 as SB\n   - BB posted 8\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 48\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - They've made several preflop raises: 8, 24, 16\n   - They seem to be an active player\n   - In hand 44, they raised to 16 then folded (possibly to a re-raise)\n   - They don't seem extremely tight or loose based on this limited sample\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 60 (4 + 8 + 48)\n   - I need to call 44 to see the flop\n   - Pot odds: 60:44 or ~1.36:1\n   - This is not great odds for a hand this weak\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have 22.2 BB which is a workable stack\n   - Calling here would commit 25% of my stack (44/178) with a terrible hand\n   - If I call and miss the flop (very likely with 6-3 offsuit), I'll be in a difficult position out of position\n   - This could easily become a -EV spot that bleeds my chips\n\n8. **Hand equity**: 6-3 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, I'm likely at best 30% equity, and probably much less against a typical raise.\n\nThe only argument for calling would be if I had a very specific read that GPT-OSS-120B is raising with complete garbage and I could outplay them postflop. But:\n- I don't have enough data to support this\n- Even if they are raising wide, 6-3 offsuit is still terrible\n- I'll be out of position which makes postflop play very difficult\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. With 6-3 offsuit in the SB facing a 6x BB raise, I should fold immediately. The hand is too weak, the position is bad, and the tournament cost is too high.\n\nI need to preserve my 22.2 BB stack for better spots.

It's ahead of most ranges.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: \n   - SB seems to fold a lot but can make big calls (called 40 chips in hand 45)\n   - BB is extremely tight, folding 10 hands in a row preflop\n4. **Stack sizes**: Both opponents have similar stacks to mine (~22-23 BB)\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 22.2 BB, I have a comfortable stack. Pocket tens is strong enough to play for value here.\n\n\nA standard raise is the most strategic play. I'll raise to 24 chips, which is 3x the big blind, to build the pot with my strong pocket tens. This sizing puts pressure on opponents while remaining consistent with standard preflop raise sizes. The button position gives me maximum flexibility post-flop, and the raise will help define my opponents' hand ranges.",

I need to play very tight from this position.\n\n**Stack**: 190 chips (23.8 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament play. I need to be careful with my chips.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in SB: Has folded preflop in the last 10 hands consecutively! Very tight player.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in BB: Mixed playstyle - has called, raised, and folded. Showdowns show they've played some decent hands (Ks-Jc, Ac-Jh, Jd-Ad).\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to see a flop. The pot is 12 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. This is not enough to justify playing 2-3 offsuit.\n\n**Key considerations**:\n1. My hand is extremely weak - no pair, no suited cards, not connected (2 and 3 with different suits)\n2. I'm in the worst position (UTG) \n3. I have a short-ish stack that I need to preserve\n4. The SB player is very tight (folded 10 straight preflop hands)\n5. The BB player is more active and could defend their blind\n\nFrom UTG with 23.8 BB, I should only be playing premium hands. 2-3 offsuit is an instant fold. Even if the blinds are tight, I can't justify playing this hand. It's -EV in the long run.\n\nThe only argument for playing this would be if I was deep stacked and in late position with multiple limpers, but neither is true here.\n\nDecision: **FOLD**",

It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 190 chips (23.8 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament poker. We're in the danger zone where we need to be careful.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 4/8 - So the big blind is 8 chips.\n\n5. **Pot**: 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8)\n\n6. **Action**: I need to call 8 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom the observation history, I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently from various positions (hands 40, 42, 43, 45)\n- GPT-OSS-120B also raises frequently and aggressively (hands 42, 44, 45)\n- Both players seem to be active and aggressive\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- I'm UTG with a marginal speculative hand (9-8 suited)\n- With 23.8 BB, I should be playing tighter, especially from early position\n- Suited connectors like 98s play better in late position or when I can see a cheap flop\n- From UTG, if I call 8 chips, I'm likely to face a raise from one of the aggressive players behind me\n- If I raise, I don't have enough fold equity with my stack size, and I'll be committed to the pot with a marginal hand\n\n**Decision**: Fold\n\n**Reasoning**:\n1. Poor position (UTG) - worst position at the table\n2. Marginal hand strength for UTG play - 98s is too weak to play from early position with a short stack\n3. Short stack (23.8 BB) - need to preserve chips for better spots\n4. Aggressive players behind me - high likelihood of facing a raise\n5. Tournament considerations - with a short stack, I need to be selective and look for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands\n\nThis is a clear fold. I should wait for a better hand or better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with A\u26609\u2660\n- My stack: 178 chips (22.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Everyone folded to me\n- I need to call 4 more (SB already posted)\n- Minimum raise to: 16\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2 in BB):**\nLooking at the opponent actions for Kimi-K2 (Seat 2):\n- Very tight player - folded many times preflop\n- Only raised preflop twice in recent hands (hands 36, 37, 49)\n- In hand 45: called 40, then check-folded on flop\n- In hand 49: raised to 24, bet 48 on flop, then raised to 144 (went all-in), ended up showing KcTc on a QQQ board\n\nThis player seems to play very tight, folding most hands, but when they do play, they can be aggressive. They seem to have a narrow range.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nA\u26609\u2660 is a decent hand on the button:\n- Suited Ace with a decent kicker\n- Good stealing hand\n- Can make nut flushes\n- Position advantage\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Position**: I'm on the button, best position post-flop\n2. **Stack**: 22.2 BB - healthy stack, not desperate\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight BB, likely to fold to steal attempts\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds) - good for calling\n5. **Steal opportunity**: Since everyone folded, this is a good spot to steal blinds\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight, A9s is good enough to play from BTN\n- **Call**: Could call and see a flop, but might let BB see free flop\n- **Raise**: Good stealing spot. Should raise to pressure the tight BB\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature, a raise seems best. The minimum raise is 16 (2x BB), which is standard. I could also raise a bit more to 20-24 to really pressure them.\n\nLet me raise to 20 (2.5x BB) which is a solid steal size that should get folds from a tight player often enough to be profitable. If called, I have position and a decent hand.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise calculation: \n- Pot is 12 (4+8)\n- To raise, I need to make it at least 16 total (which is 2x the BB)\n- So raising to 16 would be the minimum\n- Raising to 20 or 24 would be more standard\n\nLet me go with 20 - it's a solid raise size that should fold out the tight BB often enough.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I need to analyze the current situation and recall opponent information to make an informed decision.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN\n- Hand: As 9s (decent suited Ace)\n- Stack: 162 chips (20.2 BB)\n- Board: 5h 6s 6h\n- Pot: 40 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Board shows 5h 6s 6h - paired board with two hearts\n- I have As 9s - no pair, no flush draw (spades), no straight draw\n- My hand is essentially Ace-high on a paired board\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) actions:\n- Very tight preflop - lots of folds in hands 38-44\n- In hand 45: called 40 preflop, then check-folded on flop\n- In hand 49: raised preflop 24, bet 48 on flop, raised to 144 on flop, then checked turn and river\n- This suggests they can be aggressive with strong hands but also play passively when they miss\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 20.2 BB - a decent stack but not huge\n- The pot is 40 chips - already a decent size relative to stacks\n- I'm out of position (BTN vs BB) but actually have position advantage postflop\n\n**Decision:**\nThe flop is 5h 6s 6h. This is a paired board which is good for continuation betting as the preflop raiser. My opponent called preflop from the BB, which could mean:\n- They're defending their blind with a wide range\n- They could have pairs, suited connectors, broadways, or even Ace-high hands\n\nGiven that I was the preflop raiser and have position, I should make a continuation bet here. The paired board makes it less likely they connected strongly. My Ace-high might still be good, and I can represent having a 6 or an overpair.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that they called a 2.5x raise from the BB, so they have something. But with 20BB stacks and a 40 chip pot, checking is also reasonable to pot control with Ace-high.\n\nLet me think about sizing. The pot is 40, minimum raise is 12. A standard c-bet would be around 20-30 chips (50-75% pot).\n\nGiven my opponent's tendency to fold to pressure (as seen in hand 45 where they check-folded), and the fact that this is a paired board that hits my perceived range well, I should make a continuation bet. But I need to be careful with my stack size.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have Ace-high on a paired board. If I bet and get called or raised, I'll be in a tough spot. Checking gives me a free card to potentially hit an Ace or 9, and keeps the pot small with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven that I have position and can control the pot size, checking is probably the better play here. I can re-evaluate on the turn. If my opponent checks again, I might bet then as a delayed c-bet. If they bet, I can decide based on the size and my read.\n\nLet me go with check.",

Check - Take a free card, see the river\n2. Bet - Try to take down the pot now\n3. Raise - Not relevant since there's no bet to raise\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- I have position (on the button)\n- I have a decent but not strong hand\n- The opponent checked the flop, showing weakness\n- The turn card (Qh) could have helped:\n  - If opponent had a Q, they might have bet\n  - The heart could complete a flush draw\n  - The Q is an overcard to the board\n\n**Strategy:**\nThis is a good spot for a probe bet. The opponent showed weakness by checking the flop, and I can represent having a Q or better. A small bet could take down the pot. If I get called or raised, I can re-evaluate on the river.\n\nGiven I have position and the opponent has shown weakness, I should make a small value bet or bluff bet to try to win the pot now. Something like 15-20 chips (about 1/2 to 3/4 pot) would be appropriate.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The board is paired (6s), so trip 6s is possible. The Qh could be scary for both of us. The opponent checked the flop on a relatively dry board (except for the flush draw).\n\nActually, with As 9s, I have:\n- Overcard Ace\n- Backdoor flush draw (spades)\n- The board is paired\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the check on flop, I think a small bet here is good. But checking is also fine to see a free river card.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes. I have 20.2 BB, which is healthy. I don't need to take unnecessary risks. The pot is 40 chips, which is 5 BB. \n\nIf I check, I get a free card to hit my Ace or maybe improve in other ways.\nIf I bet, I risk chips but could win the pot immediately.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the fact they checked the flop, I think betting is better. I can represent the Q and get them to fold hands like pocket pairs, 5x, or small pairs.\n\nA bet of 20-25 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot) seems appropriate. This is about 2.5-3 BB.\n\nLet me go with a bet of 20 chips. This is a reasonable probe bet that gives me a chance to win the pot now.\n\nActually, wait. Looking at the legal actions again: \"fold, check, raise\". It says \"raise\" not \"bet\". But the minimum raise to is 12. This is confusing. Let me think about this...\n\nIf the amount to call is 0, and I can \"raise\" to 12, that means I can bet. In poker terminology,"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- My position: BTN (good position)\n- My cards: As 9s (Ace of spades, 9 of spades)\n- My stack: 162 chips (20.2 BB)\n- Board: 5h 6s 6h Qh (paired board, two hearts, potential flush draw)\n- Pot: 40 chips\n- Bet to call: 0 (checking is free)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from seat 2:\n- Very tight preflop player (folded many times, only raised occasionally)\n- Hand #45: Called 40 preflop, then check-folded on flop (showing weakness postflop)\n- Hand #49: Raised preflop, bet 48 on flop, raised to 144 on flop, then checked turn and river (this suggests a strong hand on the flop but then giving up)\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 20, opponent called 12\n- Flop: 5h 6s 6h - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: Qh - I can check for free\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have As 9s\n- The board is 5h 6s 6h Qh\n- There's a pair of 6s on board\n- There's a potential flush draw (hearts)\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (if a 7 or 8 comes, I don't have much)\n- I have an overcard Ace\n- My 9s is not very relevant\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips\n- I can check for free, so pot odds are irrelevant here\n\n**Opponent Range:**\nGiven the tight play and the check on the flop, opponent likely has:\n- Weak to medium strength hand\n- Maybe a pocket pair below Queens\n- Maybe a 5 (trip 5s)\n- Maybe a flush draw\n- Maybe complete air\n\n**My Options:**\n1. Check - Take a free card, see the river\n2. Bet - Try to take down the pot now\n3. Raise - Not relevant since there's no bet to raise\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- I have position (on the button)\n- I have a decent but not strong hand\n- The opponent checked the flop, showing weakness\n- The turn card (Qh) could have helped:\n  - If opponent had a Q, they might have bet\n  - The heart could complete a flush draw\n  - The Q is an overcard to the board\n\n**Strategy:**\nThis is a good spot for a probe bet. The opponent showed weakness by checking the flop, and I can represent having a Q or better. A small bet could take down the pot. If I get called or raised, I can re-evaluate on the river.\n\nGiven I have position and the opponent has shown weakness, I should make a small value bet or bluff bet to try to win the pot now. Something like 15-20 chips (about 1/2 to 3/4 pot) would be appropriate.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The board is paired (6s), so trip 6s is possible. The Qh could be scary for both of us. The opponent checked the flop on a relatively dry board (except for the flush draw).\n\nActually, with As 9s, I have:\n- Overcard Ace\n- Backdoor flush draw (spades)\n- The board is paired\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the check on flop, I think a small bet here is good. But checking is also fine to see a free river card.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes. I have 20.2 BB, which is healthy. I don't need to take unnecessary risks. The pot is 40 chips, which is 5 BB. \n\nIf I check, I get a free card to hit my Ace or maybe improve in other ways.\nIf I bet, I risk chips but could win the pot immediately.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the fact they checked the flop, I think betting is better. I can represent the Q and get them to fold hands like pocket pairs, 5x, or small pairs.\n\nA bet of 20-25 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot) seems appropriate. This is about 2.5-3 BB.\n\nLet me go with a bet of 20 chips. This is a reasonable probe bet that gives me a chance to win the pot now.\n\nActually, wait. Looking at the legal actions again: \"fold, check, raise\". It says \"raise\" not \"bet\". But the minimum raise to is 12. This is confusing. Let me think about this...\n\nIf the amount to call is 0, and I can \"raise\" to 12, that means I can bet. In poker terminology,",

Queen-high with a 3 kicker is not a hand I want to play, especially from the button when there are only two players left to act (SB and BB).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is minimized.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**:\n   - **SB (Seat 2)**: Seems to play relatively tight but can make big raises with strong hands (hand 49). They also called a raise preflop in hand 50 but folded on the turn. They seem capable of making moves.\n   - **BB (Seat 3)**: Very tight! They've folded 8 out of 9 hands preflop, only raising once. This suggests they're playing a very tight, conservative game. They're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 202 chips (25.2 BB)\n   - SB has 156 chips (19.5 BB)\n   - BB has 188 chips (23.5 BB)\n   - All stacks are relatively shallow, which means we should be more cautious with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 12. That's 1.5:1 odds, which requires me to win at least 40% of the time. With Q3o, I definitely don't have that equity against any reasonable range.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 25.2 BB, I'm in a decent position but not comfortable. I should be looking to preserve my stack or find good spots to accumulate chips. Q3o is not a good spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q3o is one of the weakest hands in poker, and even on the button, I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand against two opponents when I have no information that they're playing extremely loose. The BB is particularly tight, so if I call and they raise, I'll be in a tough spot. If I raise, I might get called by the SB or re-raised by the BB, and then I'll be building a pot with a hand that has very"

They're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 202 chips (25.2 BB)\n   - SB has 156 chips (19.5 BB)\n   - BB has 188 chips (23.5 BB)\n   - All stacks are relatively shallow, which means we should be more cautious with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 12. That's 1.5:1 odds, which requires me to win at least 40% of the time. With Q3o, I definitely don't have that equity against any reasonable range.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 25.2 BB, I'm in a decent position but not comfortable. I should be looking to preserve my stack or find good spots to accumulate chips. Q3o is not a good spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q3o is one of the weakest hands in poker, and even on the button, I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand against two opponents when I have no information that they're playing extremely loose. The BB is particularly tight, so if I call and they raise, I'll be in a tough spot. If I raise, I might get called by the SB or re-raised by the BB, and then I'll be building a pot with a hand that has very",

It's not suited, not connected, and the 3 kicker is terrible. This is a bottom-tier hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is minimal.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1). This means I need ~40% equity to break even. Q3o has nowhere near that against any reasonable range.\n\n4. **Stack size**: 25.2 BB is relatively short in a tournament.

It's unsuited, unconnected, and both cards are low.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 5c 2d is extremely weak. No pair potential, no straight potential (would need 3-4-6), no flush potential. This is a folding hand in virtually all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under The Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have to act first, and there are 4 players behind me who could wake up with strong hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 202 chips (25.2 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep. Tournament play requires careful stack preservation.\n\n4. **Opponents**: The search for observations on Seats 4 and 5 returned no results, so I have no specific reads on these opponents.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a 25 BB stack, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is definitely not the spot. I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have to call 8 to win 12, which is 1.5:1 odds. These odds are not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 5c 2d is unplayable from UTG position. I don't want to invest 8 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will almost never be profitable. Even if the blinds are weak players, the risk of running into a strong hand from one of the 4 players behind me is too high.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: I have a trash hand in early position with a decent stack size. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nLet me format the response correctly according to the required JSON format.",

Even though I can check for free, I should consider:\n1. My hand has very little potential - J4o is one of the worst hands in poker\n2. I'll be out of position postflop\n3. MiniMax has shown they can be aggressive postflop\n4. Even though I have pot odds to check, playing this hand will likely cost me chips postflop\n5. With a healthy but not huge stack of 24 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots\n\nThe only argument for checking is that it's free and the pot is 20 chips. But J4o is so weak that even hitting a J will often be problematic (kicker issues), and hitting a 4 isn't much better. I'll be out of position against an opponent who can be aggressive.\n\nI should fold and save my chips for better spots. Folding costs me nothing additional since the BB was already posted.",

They also make big moves - like that raise to 96 chips on the flop in hand 49.\n\nNow let me look at the current situation:\n- I have Jc 4d - bottom pair with a weak kicker\n- Board: 2h 4h 3h - there's a flush draw and straight draw possible\n- I have 194 chips (24.2 BB)\n- Pot is 20 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 called preflop from MP position and is now facing me\n\nMy hand: I have a pair of 4s with J kicker. The board is very coordinated with 3 hearts (flush draw) and potential straight draws (A-5 makes a straight).\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's aggressive tendencies on flops (they bet or raise on flops in hands 42, 43, and 49), I should be cautious. My hand is vulnerable to:\n1. Any heart (flush)\n2. Any 5 (makes a straight)\n3. Any higher pair\n4. Any Ace (if they have A-h)\n\nI should check here. Betting with a marginal hand like this on a dangerous board against an aggressive opponent is not a good idea. Let me see what they do first. If they check back, I might consider a value bet on the turn if the board pairs or I improve.\n\nChecking is the standard play here with a marginal made hand on a dangerous board out of position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Jc 4d\n- My stack: 194 chips (24.2 BB)\n- Board: 2h 4h 3h 2s 8d\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) with 229 chips\n- Action: It's checked to me, I can check or bet\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a pair of 4s (Jc 4d)\n- Board shows: 2h 4h 3h 2s 8d\n- This is a very coordinated board with 3 hearts (flush possible), and a pair on board (2s)\n- Possible hands opponent could have:\n  - Flush (any heart)\n  - Full house (any 2)\n  - Straight (A-5 possible)\n  - Trips (any 8)\n  - Two pair\n  - Single pair\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have bottom pair (4s) with a Jack kicker\n- The board is very dangerous with multiple draws that have completed\n- Any heart beats me (flush)\n- Any 2 beats me (full house or trips)\n- Any 8 beats me (trips)\n- A-5 straight is possible\n- I'm likely beat by many hands\n\n**Opponent Tendency Analysis:**\nFrom the search results, MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 43: Raised preflop from UTG with Q9o, bet flop, checked turn/river - showed down Jd Ad (bluff or weak hand)\n- Hand 44: Folded preflop\n- Hand 45: Folded preflop\n- Hand 46: Folded preflop\n- Hand 48: Folded preflop\n- Hand 49: Called 24 preflop, called flop raise, checked down - showed down 6d Ts (weak hand)\n- Hand 50: Folded preflop\n- Hand 51: Folded preflop\n- Hand 52: Folded preflop\n- Hand 53: Folded preflop\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is very tight, folds a lot preflop. When they do play, they tend to be passive and show down weak hands. They've shown a tendency to check down when they have marginal hands.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 8 (limp/call)\n- Flop: Checked to them, they checked\n- Turn: Checked to them, they checked\n- River: Checked to me\n\nThis passive line suggests they have a weak or marginal hand. They would likely bet the river if they had a strong hand like a flush, full house, or trips.\n\n**My Decision:**\nI have bottom pair on a very dangerous board. However:\n1. The opponent has shown extreme passivity\n2. They've checked all three streets\n3. They would likely value bet any strong hand\n4. My hand might be good against their range\n\nBut the board is extremely dangerous. Any heart, any 2, any 8 beats me. That's a LOT of cards. Even though MiniMax-M2 is passive, checking down doesn't guarantee they have nothing. They could have:\n- A weak heart (like 5h, 6h, 7h, 9h, Th) that makes a low flush\n- A 2 (though unlikely given preflop call)\n- An 8\n- Or just complete air\n\nGiven:\n- The board is very coordinated and dangerous\n- I only have bottom pair\n- Opponent is passive but could still have a flush or trips\n- Pot is small (20 chips)\n- I have 24 BB stack\n\nThis is a clear check situation. I should not bet for value because:\n1. I don't get called by worse often enough\n2. I get called/raised by better frequently\n3. The risk/reward is poor\n\nI should check and hope to win at showdown with my bottom pair, or fold to any aggression.\n\n**Final Decision: CHECK**\n\nI want to see a cheap showdown. My hand is likely marginal at best, and betting would be risky. The opponent's passivity suggests they might have nothing, but the board is too dangerous to value bet.",

Even in position, this hand is:\n- Not connected (7-card gap)\n- Not suited\n- No high card value\n- Very unlikely to make strong hands\n\nThe pot is only 12 chips and I need to call 4 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is decent, but with this hand, even those odds aren't enough.

When a tight player raises, they typically have a strong range: high pocket pairs (AA-QQ), AK, AQ, AJ, maybe KQ.\n\n**Hand evaluation:**\nK9o is a marginal hand at best. It's dominated by:\n- All better kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT)\n- All pocket pairs 99+\n- Even against a hand like AQ, we're only about 45% equity\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 24 to win 36, which is 24/(24+36) = 40% equity needed to break even.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the cutoff which is good position, but there are still players behind me (Seats 2, 3, 4) who could 3-bet or call.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 26.2 BB, which is a decent stack in a tournament. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is important.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAgainst a tight player who has been folding almost everything, this raise represents real strength. K9o is too weak to call here. Even with position, I'm likely dominated or flipping at best. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

This is a marginal hand at best.\n2. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB), which is a disadvantage.\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 called preflop. Looking at their history:\n   - They tend to call preflop with marginal hands (called 8 and 16 chips)\n   - They check-folded on the flop in hand 57 after calling 16 preflop\n   - They play passively post-flop (lots of checking)\n   - They haven't shown any aggression in the recalled hands\n\n4. **Board texture:** The board is somewhat coordinated with:\n   - Two clubs (flush draw possible)\n   - Straight draws (2-4, 4-7)\n   - I have a 6, which gives me bottom pair\n\n5. **Pot odds:** The pot is 20 chips and I can check for free. Checking is essentially 0 risk.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack (25.2 BB) and don't need to take unnecessary risks with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** Given that:\n- I have bottom pair with a weak kicker\n- The board is coordinated with potential draws\n- I'm out of position\n- My opponent plays passively\n- I can see the turn for free\n\nI should **check**. Betting here would be a bluff or semi-bluff, but with bottom pair and a weak kicker, I don't have much fold equity. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 6s 9c - I have bottom pair (6s) on a board of 5c 3c 6d\n**Position:** BB (out of position)\n**Stack:** 202 chips (25.2 BB) - healthy stack\n**Board:** 5c 3c 6d - Rainbow board with some straight draws (2-4, 4-7)\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 bet 8 chips on the flop\n- I need to call 8 to see the turn\n- Minimum raise to 16\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2 in seat 4):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 57: Called preflop 16, checked flop, then folded to a bet\n- Hand 54: Called preflop 8, checked flop, turn, river (showed down Ac 7d on 2h 4h 3h 2s 8d - they had Ace high on a scary board)\n- Hand 49: Called 24 preflop, raised to 96 on flop, then called 48, checked turn and river (showed 6d Ts on Td Qs Qd Qh 5d - they had trips)\n- Generally seems to call preflop with a wide range but plays passively postflop unless they have strong hands\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have bottom pair with a 9 kicker\n- The board is relatively dry (rainbow, no high cards)\n- There are straight draws: A-2-4, 2-4-7, 4-7-8\n- I could be ahead of many hands like Ace-high, King-high, straight draws\n- But vulnerable to any overpair, any 5 or 3, or higher pairs\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 28, I need to call 8\n- Getting 3.5:1 on my call\n- This is good pot odds\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Weak made hand (bottom pair). Could be best but vulnerable.\n2. **Position:** Out of position, which is bad\n3. **Opponent:** Seems to be betting small (8 into 28). This could be a probe bet, value bet with a 5 or 3, or a bluff/semi-bluff.\n4. **Stack preservation:** With 25 BB, I don't want to get into a big pot with such a weak hand\n5. **Pot odds:** Good immediate pot odds, but implied odds are questionable out of position\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too weak given the pot odds and opponent's small bet\n- **Call:** Could be reasonable given pot odds, but out of position with a weak hand is problematic\n- **Raise:** Could raise to protect my hand and get better hands to fold, but what worse hands call? Also risks building a big pot with a marginal hand\n\nGiven that the opponent's bet is small (less than 1/3 pot), and I have a made hand (even if weak), and I'm getting good pot odds, calling seems reasonable. However, I need to be prepared to fold on many turn cards if they continue betting.\n\nI think calling is the best option here. It's a small investment relative to the pot, and I could be ahead of many hands. If they continue aggressive action on the turn, I can re-evaluate.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With bottom pair and a weak kicker, out of position, even though the bet is small, I'm not thrilled about calling. The opponent could have:\n- A 5 or 3 (ahead of me)\n- A better 6 (ahead of me)\n- A pocket pair (ahead of me)\n- A straight draw (behind me but has equity)\n- Two overcards (behind me but has 6 outs)\n\nGiven my stack size of 25 BB, I should be more conservative. The problem with calling is that I'll face difficult decisions on the turn and river out of position. I don't want to bleed chips with a marginal hand.\n\nI think folding is actually the better play here. Preserve my stack for better spots. The small bet size is inviting, but I need to think about future streets and my positional disadvantage.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s 8h - This is a suited connector (suited one-gapper actually). It's a decent speculative hand in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 198 chips (24.8 BB), which is a healthy but not huge stack.\n\n4. **Current situation**: Everyone has folded to me except the BB (Seat 2). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the opponent's history:\n   - They seem to play a relatively tight game\n   - They've folded preflop in several recent hands (hands 53, 54, 56, 59)\n   - When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 49, 52, 58) and sometimes call (hands 50, 51, 57)\n   - Their raises are typically 24 chips (3x BB), which is standard\n   - In hand 49, they showed down Kc Tc on a board that gave them trips, suggesting they can play strong hands aggressively\n   - In hand 57, they called a 24 chip raise preflop and then called 50 on the flop before folding on the turn\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win a pot of 12 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is very good for a speculative hand like 78s.\n\n7. **Implied odds**: Since I'm in position and the opponent has shown willingness to call bets postflop (like in hand 57 where they called 50 on the flop), there are good implied odds if I hit a strong hand.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 24.8 BB, I can afford to take a speculative flop here. The risk is minimal (4 chips) and the potential reward is good.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear call. I have:\n- Good position (BTN)\n- A playable speculative hand (78s)\n- Great pot odds (3:1)\n- Good implied odds against an opponent who plays postflop\n- Minimal risk to my stack\n\nI'll call the 4 chips and see the flop in position.",

I can act last.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Pot is 16 chips, I can check for free right now.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak pair + straight draw. Not strong, but has potential\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on button)\n3. **Opponent**: Seems somewhat tight, checked to me\n4. **Stack size**: Healthy at 24.2 BB\n5. **Pot size**: Small at 16 chips\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: See a free turn card, no risk\n- **Raise**: Try to take it down now or charge opponent to draw\n\nGiven that I have some equity (pair + straight draw) and I'm in position, checking seems reasonable to see the turn card for free. However, I could also consider a small value bet with my pair + draw.\n\nBut wait - the opponent checked to me. They could have:\n- Nothing (air)\n- A better pair (9s, Ts, Js, etc.)\n- A higher pair\n- A straight draw\n- Two overcards\n\nWith my weak pair and straight draw, I think checking is the best option. I want to see the turn card for free and re-evaluate. If I bet and get raised, I'd have a tough decision. If I bet and get called, I'm not sure where I stand.\n\nChecking allows me to:\n1. See a free turn card\n2. Potentially improve to two pair, trips, or a straight\n3. Keep the pot small with my marginal hand\n4. Use my positional advantage later\n\nI don't think I need to bet here for \"protection\" since the board is relatively safe and my hand isn't strong enough to value bet.\n\nLet me check.",

The Ah is concerning.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position\n3. **Opponent**: Based on history, opponent can be aggressive but has been folding a lot recently. They checked twice, suggesting weakness.\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 16, I can check for free\n5. **Tournament**: I'm at 24.2 BB, which is healthy but not deep\n\n**What should I do?**\n- Checking seems weak - I have some showdown value\n- Betting could take down the pot now, but what if I get raised?\n- The Ah is scary - opponent could have Ax\n- However, they checked the flop with an 8 on board and now checked the turn with an Ace\n\nGiven that:\n- Opponent has shown weakness by checking twice\n- I have some showdown value with middle pair\n- I could try a small value bet to extract value from worse hands or take the pot\n- But betting risks getting raised and having to fold\n\nI think checking is the safest play here. I have a marginal hand, the board is getting scary with the Ace, and I can see a free river card. If I bet and get raised, I'll likely have to fold. Checking allows me to realize my equity and potentially get to showdown cheaply.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, with middle pair on a board with an Ace, and an opponent who has shown they can be aggressive, checking is definitely the right play. I don't want to build a big pot with a marginal hand, and checking keeps the pot small.\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about this differently. I have a pair of 8s. The opponent has checked twice. This could mean:\n1. They have nothing and are giving up\n2. They have a weak hand and are scared of the Ace\n3. They have a monster and are trapping (less likely given they checked flop too)\n\nIf I bet small, like 8-12 chips:\n- I might get called by worse hands (6x, 3x, pocket pairs below 8)\n- I might get folds from complete air\n- If I get raised, I can fold\n\nBut given the Ace on board and my marginal hand, I think the conservative play is to check. I have showdown value and don't need to inflate the pot.\n\nFinal decision: Check.",

The opponent's bet suggests strength, and there are too many hands that beat me. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, I don't have enough equity to call here with just bottom pair.\n\nThe pot odds of 3.33:1 would require me to win about 30% of the time. Given the board texture and opponent's betting pattern, I don't think I have that much equity.\n\n**Recommendation: Fold**",

Has folded preflop in last 9 hands (52-60)\n- Only showed down with weak hands like Q3s and KA\n- Very conservative player\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is a decent hand, especially on the button\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent position post-flop\n3. **Stack sizes**: All stacks are relatively short (12.1 BB, 7.4 BB, 10.5 BB)\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents appear tight, especially the BB who has folded 9 straight hands\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 12.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. This is a decent spot.\n\n**Decision options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight, K9o on button is playable\n- **Call**: Could be okay, but with these short stacks and tight opponents, I could also consider raising\n- **Raise**: Good option to steal blinds. Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB), which puts pressure on short stacks\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button with a decent hand\n- Both opponents are short-stacked and tight\n- The BB has folded 9 straight hands preflop\n- I need to accumulate chips with 12.1 BB\n\nI think raising to steal the blinds is the best play. A standard raise to 32 (2 BB) risks 32 to win 24, which is good. Even if called, I have position and a decent hand.\n\nLet me raise to 32 chips.",

It's not strong enough to call a big raise with a short stack.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I have 162 chips (10.1 BB). This is a relatively short stack in a tournament. Calling 136 chips would leave me with only 26 chips (1.6 BB), which is extremely short.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 208 chips and I need to call 136 chips. That's about 1.5:1 pot odds. K9 offsuit against a likely range from the BB who is re-raising after I min-raised is not good enough.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has 16 chips and is in the BB. They posted 16 and now are raising to 168. Since they only have 16 chips, they must be all-in. Wait, let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the stacks again:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 16 chips\n- They posted BB of 16\n- I raised to 32\n- They raised to 168\n\nSince Seat 3 only has 16 chips, they cannot raise to 168. This must mean the \"16 chips\" is their stack AFTER posting the BB. So they started with 32 chips, posted BB of 16, and are now raising all-in for 16 more (total 32).\n\nBut the amount to call is 136, which means the raise is to 168 total (32 + 136). This is confusing.\n\nLet me recalculate: If I raised to 32, and the amount to call is 136, then the total bet is 168 (32 + 136 = 168). Since Seat 3 shows as having 16 chips, I think the hand history is showing that Seat 3 started with 184 chips (16 + 168), posted BB of 16, leaving 168, and then raised all-in for 168.\n\nSo the situation is:\n- Pot: 208 chips\n- I need to call 136 chips\n- If I call, I'll have 26 chips left\n- I'm facing an all-in raise from the BB\n\nWith K9 offsuit and a stack of 10.1 BB, I should fold here. The hand is not strong enough to call off most of my stack. I should preserve my 162 chips (10.1 BB) for a better spot. K9 offsuit is dominated by many hands that would make this play (any Ace, any King with better kicker, any pair, etc.).\n\nThe math: I need to call 136 to win 208 + 136 = 344 chips. That's about 2.5:1 pot odds. But with K9 offsuit, I likely have less than 40% equity against the BB's range, making this a -EV call.\n\nI should fold and keep my 10.1 BB stack for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: As 7d - Ace-seven offsuit. This is a marginal hand, especially in CO position.\n\n2. **My stack**: 162 chips (10.1 BB) - This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n3. **The action**: \n   - SB posted 8\n   - BB posted 16\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 283 (which is effectively all-in since they have 0 chips left)\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 283 to win 307 (the pot). That's about 1.08:1 pot odds, which is terrible.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight - mostly folding preflop with occasional small raises. This large raise (283) from a player who is now at 0 chips suggests they went all-in. This is likely a strong hand.\n\n6. **My situation**: \n   - I have 162 chips, so calling 283 would mean going all-in for 162\n   - The pot is 307, so if I call 162, the pot would be 469\n   - My pot odds would be 162/469 = about 34.5% equity needed\n   - With A7o, I'm unlikely to have that much equity against a likely strong range\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 10.1 BB, I should be looking for better spots. A7o is not a strong enough hand to call an all-in, especially against what appears to be a tight player making a large all-in raise.\n\nThe decision is clear: I should fold. A7o is too weak to call an all-in here, and I need to preserve my 10.1 BB stack for better opportunities.",

Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand (#63) - PREFLOP:**\n- **Position:** UTG (Under the Gun, Seat 1) - this is the worst position\n- **Hole Cards:** 3c 8s (3 of clubs, 8 of spades) - This is a terrible hand, offsuit and low\n- **Stack:** 162 chips (10.1 BB) - This is a short stack\n- **Blinds:** 8/16\n- **Pot:** 24 chips\n- **Amount to call:** 16 chips\n- **Minimum raise:** 32 chips\n- **Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\n**Players at table:**\n- Seat 1: Kimi-K2 (me) - 162 chips\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 118 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 216 chips\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 189 chips\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 291 chips\n\n**My recent hand history analysis:**\nLooking at the last 10 hands played:\n- Hand 62: CO position, folded As 7d preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 61: BTN position, raised to 32 with Ks 9d, then folded (likely to a re-raise)\n- Hand 60: SB position, called with 7s 8h, then folded on turn\n- Hand 59: BB position, checked with 6s 9c, folded on flop\n- Hand 58: UTG position, folded 7d 2d preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 57: CO position, folded 9d Kc preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 56: BTN position, folded Kc 7c preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 55: SB position, folded 2h 9d preflop (good fold)\n- Hand 54: BB position, checked Jc 4d, won 20 chips\n- Hand 53: UTG position, folded 5c 2d preflop (good fold)\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. I've been playing very tight, folding most hands preflop\n2. My stack is critically short at 10.1 BB\n3. I'm in the worst position (UTG)\n4. My hand is 3c 8s - absolutely terrible, one of the worst starting hands in poker\n5. I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- With 10.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory, but this is NOT a pushing hand\n- From UTG, I should only play premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe AQ)\n- 3c 8s has no equity, no playability, and is dominated by virtually any calling range\n- Even if I could steal the blinds, it's not worth risking 10% of my stack with this garbage\n- The table hasn't seen me show down many hands, so I have a tight image, but that doesn't justify playing this hand\n\n**Decision:** FOLD\n\nThis is a trivial fold. I need to preserve my short stack for a better opportunity. With 10.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, and 3c 8s UTG is a clear fold. I should wait for a better hand or better position (ideally both) before committing chips.",

When they limp in, they likely have marginal to decent hands but are not strong enough to raise.\n\n**My situation:**\n- I'm short stacked at 9.1 BB\n- I have a terrible hand (Q4o)\n- I can check and see a free flop\n- If I raise, I'd be risking 32 chips (22% of my stack) with a terrible hand\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. There's no reason to invest more chips with Q4o. Even though I'm short stacked, I should preserve my chips for better spots. The pot is already 40 chips, which is decent relative to my stack, but I have no hand equity to speak of.\n\nChecking is free and gives me a chance to hit something (though unlikely). If I hit a Q on the flop, I might be able to get value from MiniMax-M2's weak range. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nRaising would be spewing chips with a terrible hand. Even if MiniMax-M2 is tight, they could easily have a better hand than Q4o, and I'm risking 22% of my stack.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free flop.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q4o is a very weak hand with no potential.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at MiniMax-M2's history, I can see they have been very tight - folding preflop most of the time (15 out of 20 actions), and when they do call, they seem passive postflop (check-fold pattern in hand 57). In hand 59, they called preflop and then bet 8 on the flop.\n\nNow let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 4d Qc - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack to make Q-J-10-9-8? No, wait... let me recalculate)\n- Board: Ac 2d Kd - There's an Ace and King on board\n- Actually, I don't have much. I have Q high, which is weak on this board. The only draw I might have is if I have a diamond (4d) for a flush draw, but I need two more diamonds. Board has one diamond (2d).\n\nLet me reconsider: I have 4d Qc. Board is Ac 2d Kd.\n- I have ONE diamond (4d) but would need two more diamonds for a flush\n- I have no pair, no straight draw really (would need J-10 for Q-J-10 straight but board is A-K-2)\n- I basically have Q-high with a backdoor flush draw\n\n**Situation:**\n- I'm in BB, heads up against MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4\n- MiniMax-M2 called preflop from what position? They called from Seat 4, which is MP (middle position)\n- They called 16 preflop, which is a standard call\n- I checked preflop (as BB)\n- Now it's checked to me on the flop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- MiniMax-M2 is very tight, folding preflop 75% of the time\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (check-fold pattern)\n- They have shown some aggression in hand 59 with a small flop bet\n\n\n- The pot is modest at 40 chips, and I'm facing a low-risk decision\n- With no bets to call, checking seems the most prudent move\n- My hand lacks significant strength or drawing potential\n- I'll preserve my stack and see if any favorable cards develop on the turn\n\nThe optimal play is to check and cautiously evaluate the next street.",

A bluff might work but it's too risky with this stack size and such a weak hand. The opponent's passivity suggests they might also have a weak hand and be willing to check it down.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 6c 8d - This is a weak hand with no suitedness, no connectivity, and low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but with such a weak hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n**Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - This is a relatively short stack. I need to be careful about preserving my chips.\n\n**Action**: Only the BB (Seat 2) remains, everyone else folded.\n\n**Opponent data**: Looking at Seat 2's actions, they have:\n- Folded preflop frequently (hands 53, 54, 56, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64)\n- Called preflop occasionally (hands 51, 57)\n- Raised preflop a few times (hands 52, 58)\n- When they do play, they seem to be somewhat aggressive postflop (bets on turn in hands 51, 60)\n\nThe opponent in the BB seems to be fairly tight, folding most of the time preflop. However, my hand 6c 8d is extremely weak. Even though I'm getting good odds (calling 8 to win 24, or 3:1), this hand has very poor equity against any reasonable BB defending range.\n\nWith 11.1 BB, I should be looking for much better spots to risk my chips. Even though I only need to call 8 chips to see a flop, if I hit something marginal, I could lose more chips postflop. And if I miss (which will happen most of the time), I just threw away 8 chips that represent 1% of my stack.\n\nThe only consideration is that the BB folds a lot preflop, so I could potentially raise and steal. But:\n1. A minimum raise to 32 would risk 32 chips (2 BB) to win 24\n2. With 11.1 BB, I can't afford to make many such attempts\n3. If called, I have a terrible hand with poor playability\n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand/spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5d 7d (5-7 suited diamonds)\n2. **Position**: Cutoff (CO), which is decent position\n3. **Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - I'm in the middle stack range\n4. **Blinds**: 8/16\n5. **Action**: Seat 5 raised to 48 (3x BB)\n6. **Amount to call**: 48\n7. **Pot**: 72 chips (includes SB, BB, and the raise)\n\nLet me calculate pot odds:\n- I need to call 48 to win 72\n- Pot odds = 48:72 = 1:1.5\n- That's about 40% equity needed\n\nMy hand: 5d 7d - This is a suited connector, but it's a weak one. It's not a premium hand, but it has some potential because:\n- Suited (can make flush)\n- Connected (can make straight)\n- Both cards are low\n\nHowever, this is a tournament situation with 11.1 BB. This is actually a short stack situation where I need to be careful.\n\nLooking at Seat 5's tendencies:\nFrom the data I retrieved, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in 16 out of 20 recent hands\n- Only raised twice: once for 24 (which could have been a steal) and once for 283 (which was likely a premium hand)\n- When they did raise in hand 57, they continued betting on flop and turn aggressively\n\nThis suggests Seat 5 is a tight player who raises with strong hands. A 3x raise from them likely means they have a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, etc.).\n\nWith 5-7 suited and 11.1 BB:\n- I don't have the odds to call with this speculative hand\n- If I call 48, I'll have 130 chips left (8.1 BB)\n- If I miss the flop (which is likely), I'll be in a tough spot\n- I could consider shoving as a semi-bluff, but with 11.1 BB, that's a big risk with a weak hand\n \nI need to preserve my tournament stack. With 11.1 BB, I'm in a critical position where I can't afford to waste chips on marginal hands. The tight raiser's range suggests I'm unlikely to win, and calling would significantly reduce my stack without a strong chance of success. Folding is the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life.",

Let me analyze:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Kh - This is a very weak hand, offsuit with a low kicker\n2. **My position**: SB - Worst position postflop\n3. **My stack**: 154 chips (9.6 BB) - Short stack, in danger zone\n4. **Action**: There's been a raise to 48, then a re-raise to 100, then another re-raise to 211\n5. **Amount to call**: 203 chips - This would commit almost my entire stack (leaving me with just 51 chips)\n6. **Legal actions**: Only fold or call (no raising allowed)\n\nLooking at the opponent actions history:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been relatively active with raises (hands 67, 69)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has made some raises but also folded to pressure\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) made a big raise to 211, which is essentially an all-in (they have 0 chips now, so they were all-in)\n\nThe action shows:\n- Seat 3 raises to 48 (3x BB)\n- Seat 4 re-raises to 100 (committing most of their short stack)\n- Seat 5 re-raises all-in to 211\n\nThis is a massive multi-way pot with very strong action. The all-in from Seat 5 suggests a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK). Seat 4's 3-bet to 100 also suggests strength. Seat 3's initial raise could be wider but still strong.\n\nWith Kh3d in the SB:\n- No suitedness\n- Very weak kicker\n- Dominated by any other King\n- No straight or flush potential\n\nCalling 203 chips would leave me with only 51 chips (3.2 BB). This is a terrible spot with a terrible hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. Even with a short stack, this hand has terrible equity against the range of hands that are showing this much strength. I need to preserve my remaining 154 chips for a better spot - ideally when I can be the aggressor or at least have a hand with some showdown value.\n\nThe pot is already 383 and it's 203 to call, so I'm getting less than 2:1 odds. Even if I somehow won, I'd only gain 180 chips net (383-203), which isn't enough to justify the risk with this hand. I need to wait for a much better spot.",

Better to preserve chips for a stronger hand or better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: 8d 6h (unsuited, low connectors)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- My stack: 154 chips (9.6 BB) - Short stacked\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 chips (1 BB)\n- To call ratio: 16/154 = ~10.4% of my stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Kimi-K2 (SB): Very tight, has folded preflop in 7 of last 9 hands. Only showed aggression once with a big raise.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Short stack (37 chips), very aggressive with multiple preflop raises. Has gone all-in or close to it several times. Seems to be in \"push/fold\" mode with a short stack.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n8-6 offsuit is a weak hand. It's not connected (gap), unsuited, and low. This hand has very poor showdown value and poor postflop playability.\n\n**Position:** Being on the button is good, but with a short stack and weak hand, this doesn't help much.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. This is terrible for 8-6 offsuit.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 9.6 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory myself. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands. Calling here would commit ~10% of my stack with a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent-specific considerations:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB is short (37 chips = 2.3 BB) and aggressive. If I call, they might shove, putting me in a tough spot.\n- Kimi-K2 in SB is tight and might fold or just complete.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 8-6 offsuit is too weak to call 1 BB with a short stack, especially when the BB is a short-stacked aggressive player who could shove on me. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nHowever, I could consider a raise. With 9.6 BB, I could shove all-in. Let me think about that:\n- If I shove 154 into a pot of 24, that's a big overbet.\n- The BB only has 37 chips, so they might call with a wide range.\n- The SB is tight and would likely fold without a strong hand.\n- With 8-6 offsuit, my equity against a random calling range from the short stack would be poor.\n\nShoving with 8-6 offsuit is a bad idea. It's a clear fold.\n\nLet me double-check: The pot is 24 (8 from SB + 16 from BB). I need to call 16. That's 40% of the pot. With 8-6 offsuit, my equity is likely 30-35% at best against random hands, and much worse against any reasonable calling range. This is -EV.\n\nFold is the correct play.",

I have to act first post-flop against everyone.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 154 chips (9.6 BB) - This is a short stack. I'm in the danger zone where I need to be careful with my chips but also look for spots to double up.\n\n4. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 511 chips (big stack). From the recall data, they seem active with raises of 32 and 100 chips in recent hands. They folded a lot preflop but when they raise, they seem to commit. They showed down AA in hand 70.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 60 chips (very short). They fold most hands but made a big raise of 48 chips in hand 67 and went all-in for 211 in hand 70 (showing AQ). They're likely in desperation mode.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 9.6 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. Q8o UTG is not a good hand to risk chips with, especially with a short stack and bad position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). While the odds are decent, the hand is too weak and the position is too bad.\n\nGiven all these factors, I should fold this hand. UTG with Q8o and a short stack is a clear fold. I need to wait for a better spot, preferably in late position with a stronger hand or when I can be the aggressor.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q8o is a weak hand from UTG position with a short stack (9.6 BB).

Not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN which is good position, but with only one opponent (BB) left to act.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 146 chips (9.1 BB) is getting short. I need to be selective but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: The BB seems to be playing tight-aggressive. They fold a lot but when they raise, they raise big. This suggests they're not defending their BB lightly.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. That's decent odds, but with such a weak hand, it's not enough.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 9.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I shouldn't be calling raises with marginal hands. I should either fold or raise (steal).\n\n**Decision**: \n- I could try to steal with a raise since opponent folds a lot\n- However, 8d Js is very weak and if called, I'm in bad shape\n- With my stack size, I should be more selective\n- The opponent has shown they can raise big when they play, so a steal attempt risks a big re-raise\n- Folding is the safest and most correct play here\n\nLet me fold this hand.",

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but not enough to compensate for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 146 chips, which is 9.1 BB. This is a short stack in tournament play. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not playing marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent information**: I checked MiniMax-M2's recent actions. They seem to be raising frequently preflop (hands 68, 70, 72) but also folding sometimes. In hand 70, they raised to 100 and then called 73 more, suggesting they had a strong hand. In hand 72, they raised to 80 and then bet 120 on the flop, showing aggression.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 9.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should only be playing premium hands or good stealing opportunities. 75o is not a hand I should be playing, even on the button. I need to preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe correct decision here is to fold. I have a terrible hand, a short stack, and no reason to invest 16 chips (1 BB) in this spot. I should wait for a better hand or a better stealing opportunity.",

Looking at their recent actions:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 74)\n- When they do raise, they tend to raise big (118, 166, 40, and now 48)\n- They went to showdown with strong hands like AK, KT, K9\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is playing relatively tight and when they raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nHand strength:\n- K6o is a weak hand, dominated by many hands that would raise\n- We're out of position\n- No suitedness, no connectivity\n\nStack considerations:\n- I have 130 chips (8.1 BB)\n- Calling would cost me 32 chips (25% of my stack)\n- If I call and miss the flop, I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- This is a tournament, so preserving my stack is important\n\nPot odds:\n- Need to call 32 to win 72\n- Getting about 2.25:1 odds\n- With K6o, this is not enough even if opponent is raising wide\n\nGiven that Seat 2 seems to be a tight player who raises with strong hands, and I have a weak hand out of position with a short stack, this is a clear fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8h 6h - suited connector, but not very strong. In SB with only 7.6 BB left, this is a short stack situation.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position post-flop)\n\n3. **Stack size**: 122 chips (7.6 BB) - very short stacked\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 32 from MP (seat 4). This is a 2x raise over the BB.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56 (24/56 = 43% equity needed)\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently - 8 raises in various situations. They seem aggressive, raising anywhere from 2x to 6x+ the BB. They raised to 32 in hand #68, to 100 in hand #70, and to 80 in hand #72. This shows they vary their raise sizes.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 7.6 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n**Analysis of 86s from SB**:\n- This is a marginal hand, especially out of position\n- As a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- From SB, I need to be very careful as I'll be out of position post-flop\n- The pot odds aren't great (need 43% equity)\n- 86s typically has around 35-40% equity against typical raising ranges\n\n**Decision**: Given my short stack (7.6 BB), being out of position, and having a marginal hand, I should fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots where I can shove with fold equity. From SB with this stack size, I should only be calling/raising with premium hands or shoving all-in to maximize fold equity.\n\nIf I call 24, I'll have 98 chips left (6.1 BB) and be out of position post-flop with a weak drawing hand. This is not a profitable situation.\n\nI should wait for a better spot - ideally when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand where I can shove all-in preflop.",

This is a short stack but not yet desperate.\n\n4. **Situation**: \n   - Blinds: 8/16\n   - Pot: 56 chips\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 32\n   - I need to call 24 to see the flop\n   - Minimum raise to 48 (if I were to shove, I'd raise to 122)\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Hand 71: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 72: Preflop raise to 80, then flop bet 120 (very aggressive)\n   - Hand 73: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 75: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 76: Preflop raise to 32, then fold (likely to a re-raise)\n   - Hand 77: Preflop check (limp), then flop fold\n   - Hand 78: Preflop fold\n\n   MiniMax-M2 appears to be playing relatively tight but makes occasional raises. When they do raise preflop, they often follow up with aggression post-flop.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56, which is 42.9% pot odds. This would require me to win at least 42.9% of the time to break even.\n\n7. **Hand Equity**: Td 2c has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, T2o only has about 40% equity. Against a typical raising range, it's likely 30% or less.\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I'm short-stacked at 7.6 BB\n   - I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n   - T2o from SB is one of the worst possible situations\n   - Even if I hit the flop (unlikely), I'll be out of position\n\n9. **Fold Equity**: If I shove all-in for 122 chips, I might have some fold equity, but MiniMax-M2 has shown they can call or raise preflop and then fold to pressure. However, risking 122 chips with T2o is terrible.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm out of position, I'm short-stacked, and the opponent has shown they can be aggressive post-flop which would put me in difficult spots. I should wait for a much better situation to risk my tournament life.",

I have:\n1. A decent hand with an Ace\n2. Fold equity against both opponents\n3. Position advantage\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qc 4h - This is a very weak hand. Q4 offsuit is a fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **My position**: BB (Big Blind) - Already invested 32 chips.\n\n3. **My stack**: 114 chips (3.6 BB) - I'm extremely short-stacked.\n\n4. **Current situation**:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 203 (all-in)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 187\n   - I need to call 171 to see the flop\n   - Pot is 438 chips\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: This player has been raising preflop (hands 75, 76) and folding many hands. The showdown history shows they had strong hands when they went to showdown (Kd9d, TcKc, AhKd). This suggests they raise with decent hands. Their all-in raise to 203 is significant.\n   \n   - **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: This player has been more selective. They've shown strong hands at showdown (AcAs, AdAc). They called the all-in, which suggests they have a strong hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 171 to win 438 chips. That's about 2.56:1 pot odds. This means I need ~28% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand strength**: Q4 offsuit has very poor equity against typical raising ranges. Against two opponents who have already shown significant strength (one all-in, one call), my Q4 is almost certainly dominated.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With only 3.6 BB left, I need to be very selective. While I'm getting short and need to make a move soon, Q4 offsuit is not the hand to do it with, especially against two opponents who have already committed significant chips.\n\n9. **My action options**: I can only fold or call (no raising option shown).\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q4 offsuit is a terrible hand to call off my tournament life with, especially against two opponents showing strength. Even though I'm short-stacked, I should wait for a better spot. The pot odds are not good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and preserve my 82 remaining chips (114-32) for a better opportunity.",

The board is K-high, so my queen is essentially worthless here.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the opponent actions I retrieved:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive preflop with multiple raises\n- They called a 187 chip bet in hand #81 (recent)\n- They've shown down strong hands: AA twice, 77, Ac7d\n- They seem to play premium hands strongly\n- On the flop in hand #72, they bet 120 after raising preflop\n- In hand #77, they checked then folded on flop\n\n**Tournament situation:**\nI'm extremely short-stacked with only 2.6 BB. I need to be looking for spots to get my money in with any decent equity or fold equity. However, this is a terrible spot:\n\n1. I have absolutely no hand strength\n2. No draw (no flush draw, no straight draw)\n3. The board is coordinated (K-high with hearts)\n4. I have no fold equity if I bet (opponent has huge stack)\n5. Checking gives me a free chance to see if I improve on turn\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. There's no value in betting here:\n- I can't get a better hand to fold\n- I have no equity if called\n- I preserve my tiny stack for a better spot\n- I get to see a free card\n\nIf I had any draw or pair, I might consider a check-raise all-in as a semi-bluff, but with Q-high on a K-high board, this is a clear check/fold situation.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With Q-high on a K-high coordinated board, I have no hand equity and no fold equity against the big stack.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in BB with Qs 5d (Queen of spades, 5 of diamonds)\n- My stack: 82 chips (2.6 BB) - very short stacked\n- Board: Kh 7h Tc (King of hearts, 7 of hearts, Ten of clubs)\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 32 on the flop\n- I need to call 32 to continue\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have absolutely nothing - just queen high\n- The board is K-7-10 with two hearts\n- I have no pair, no draw, no flush draw, no straight draw\n- My queen is not even an overcard to the board\n\n**Stack Size Consideration:**\n- I'm extremely short stacked at 2.6 BB\n- This is a tournament situation where I need to find spots to survive\n- However, calling here with Q-high would commit ~39% of my stack (32/82)\n- If I call and miss the turn, I'll have only 50 chips left (1.5 BB)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently\n- Raising occasionally (hands 68, 70, 72, 76, 79)\n- Made a big bet on flop in hand 72 (bet 120)\n- In hand 77, checked preflop then folded on flop\n- Called a big bet in hand 81 (187 chips)\n\nThe pattern suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive but also capable of folding. The current bet of 32 into a 96 pot is a small bet (1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 96\n- To call: 32\n- Pot odds: 128:32 or 4:1\n- I need 20% equity to break even on a call\n\n**My Equity:**\nWith Q-high on a K-7-10 board, I likely have very low equity. Even against a complete bluff, my queen high might not be good. I have no draws.\n\n**Tournament Consideration:**\nAs a short stack, I should be looking for spots to get my money in with decent equity. This is NOT that spot. I have:\n1. No hand strength\n2. No draws\n3. I would be committing 39% of my stack\n4. Even if I call and hit a queen on turn, I might still be behind to Kx, Tx, 7x\n\nThe best play here is to fold and preserve my 50 chips for a better spot where I have actual hand strength or decent equity.\n\nI could consider shoving all-in as a bluff, but:\n- That would be 82 chips to win 128 (pot + opponent's bet)\n- Risking my tournament life on a pure bluff with Q-high\n- Opponent might call with any pair or draw\n- This is too high risk for the situation\n\n**Decision: FOLD**",

In hand 81 they called 187 which is significant.\n\nGiven my situation:\n- I'm extremely short stacked (2.1 BB)\n- QJo is a decent hand for a short stack shove\n- The pot is already 48, and I have 66\n- If I call 16, I'll have 50 left and be pot-committed\n- I could raise to 64 (leaving me with 2 chips)\n- Or I could just shove all-in for 66\n\nFrom a tournament perspective, with 2.1 BB, I need to make a move soon. QJo on the button is definitely strong enough to shove with this stack size. The opponent is the big stack who can afford to call, but they've shown they can fold preflop too.\n\nThe best play here is to shove all-in. This maximizes fold equity and puts maximum pressure. Even if called, QJo has decent equity against most calling ranges.\n\nLet me think about the raise sizing. Minimum raise is to 64, but I have 66. I should just shove all-in for 66.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ks 6h is a very weak hand, especially out of position (BB). It's not suited, not connected, and King-high with a weak kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB (big blind) which is the worst position post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in SB (seat 4) and has limped in (called 16 after posting SB). Their stack is 718 chips (22.4 BB), which is quite healthy.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n   - Folding frequently preflop (hands 76, 78, 80, 83)\n   - Occasionally calling (hands 81, 82)\n   - Occasionally raising (hand 79)\n   - Post-flop, they bet on hand 82 but folded on hand 77\n\n   This suggests a somewhat tight player who folds often but can occasionally play hands.\n\n5. **Stack Size**: I have only 82 chips (2.6 BB), which is critically short. This is a tournament survival situation.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 64 chips, and I can check to see a free flop. That's good pot odds.\n\n7. **Tournament Consideration**: With 2.6 BB, I'm in desperate need of chips. However, K6o is a terrible hand to risk my tournament life on. I should only be playing premium hands or looking for good spots to shove.\n\n8. **Post-flop play**: If I check, I'll be out of position with a weak hand. If I hit a King, I'll have kicker problems. If I hit a 6, it's unlikely to be good.\n\nGiven my extremely short stack, I need to be very selective. While I could check and see a free flop, K6o is just too weak to play out of position, even with the pot odds. The risk of getting trapped or losing more chips post-flop is high.\n\nWith only 2.6 BB left, I should save my chips for a better spot - ideally when I have a stronger hand or better position, or when I can be the aggressor rather than calling from the blinds.\n\nThe best play here is to fold and preserve my few remaining chips for a better opportunity.",

Any Ace beats me, and there are many better Kings possible.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm extremely short. If I check and opponent bets, I might be forced to fold or call off my stack with a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 64 chips and I have 82 chips. This is a huge pot relative to my stack.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 2.6 BB, I'm in critical need of chips. I can't afford to wait for a better spot.\n\n5. **Opponent's action**: They just called from SB preflop, which could mean a wide range. The check on the flop suggests they might not have an Ace.\n\n**My options:**\n- **Check**: Risk letting opponent see a free card when I'm vulnerable. If they bet, I'll be in a tough spot with top pair weak kicker.\n- **Raise**: I could shove all-in for 82 chips into a 64 chip pot. This would be a protection bet with my top pair. Given my stack size, this might be the best play to maximize fold equity and avoid difficult decisions on later streets.\n\nGiven that I'm extremely short-stacked (2.6 BB) with top pair on a scary board, checking is too passive. I need to apply pressure now while I might have the best hand. A shove gives me fold equity and protects against draws and better hands that might check behind.\n\nI should go all-in now.",

No suitedness, no connectivity, just one high card.\n\n2. **Stack situation**: I'm extremely short stacked at 4.1 BB. This is critical tournament survival territory. I need to be very selective.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but my hand is too weak.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (pot) = 25% pot odds. Even with my short stack, this is not a good spot.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 4.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling here would leave me with 114 chips (3.6 BB) and I'd be out of position post-flop. This is terrible for my tournament life.\n\n6. **Opponent tendency**: MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop often but folds to aggression post-flop. However, with Q2o I have very little equity even if I hit.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q2o is not a hand to risk tournament life with, even from the button. I should preserve my 4.1 BB for a better spot - ideally when I can shove preflop with some fold equity or with a much stronger hand. Calling here just bleeds chips and leaves me in bad shape.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm in the SB and already posted 16. The BB is 32. So I need to call 16 more to see the flop. But with 130 chips (4.1 BB), calling 16 chips is about 12% of my stack. That's significant.\n\nWith Q2o, I have very poor equity. Even on the button (which I'm not - I'm in SB), this is a fold. The fact that I'm short stacked makes it an even clearer fold. I need to wait for a better spot to get my chips in.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My cards: 2d 7h - This is a terrible hand. 2-7 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n- My stack: 130 chips (4.1 BB) - I'm very short-stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 (to complete the small blind)\n- Minimum raise to: 64\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 2-7 offsuit is extremely weak. No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. This is a fold in almost every situation.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: I have 130 chips which is 4.1 big blinds. This is critically short. In tournament poker with such a short stack, I need to be looking for spots to get all-in with decent hands.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the Button which is the best position, but with 2-7 offsuit this doesn't help much.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 to win a pot of 48, giving me 3:1 odds. But even with these odds, 2-7 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 4.1 BB, I need to preserve my chips for a better spot. I should be looking to shove with any decent hand (any pair, any Ace, any King, any suited connector, etc.). 2-7 offsuit is not a shoving hand.\n\n6. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the BB with 686 chips (deep stack)\n   - Only one opponent to act after me since others have folded\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm short-stacked and getting 3:1 pot odds, 2-7 offsuit is just too weak. I need to wait for a better hand to risk my tournament life. The fact that I only have one opponent left (the BB) doesn't change this - 2-7 offsuit is dominated by virtually any hand the BB might have.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot, preferably when I can shove all-in with a hand that has some equity.",

I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n3. **Pot odds**: There's 96 in the pot, I need to call 32. That's 3:1 pot odds\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active, with a mix of raises, calls, and folds\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 3.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory\n- I cannot afford to call and then fold later - if I play this hand, I should be prepared to go all the way\n- 3d 4c is not a hand I want to risk my tournament life on\n\n**Pot odds analysis:**\n- Calling 32 to win 96 gives me 3:1 immediate odds\n- Even with these odds, 3-4 offsuit is just too weak\n- I'd need to hit a straight or two pair to have any chance, and the odds of that are very low\n\n**Opponent tendency:**\n- MiniMax-M2 has shown they can raise preflop (hand 79, 88)\n- They've also folded preflop several times\n- No clear pattern of being overly aggressive or passive\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. While the pot odds are decent, my hand is terrible and I'm too short-stacked to mess around with marginal spots. I need to preserve my chips for a better opportunity - ideally with a stronger hand or in a blind vs blind situation where I can shove with fold equity.\n\nIf I were to raise, minimum raise to is 96, which would leave me with only 2 chips.

It's one of the worst starting hands in Texas Hold'em.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button, which is good position post-flop, but that doesn't matter much with this hand strength.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nI have 82 chips (2.6 BB) - this is critically short. I'm in \"push/fold\" territory where I should either go all-in or fold. I cannot afford to play speculative hands.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions (Seat 4, BB):\n- Hand 79: Raised preflop to 32\n- Hand 80: Folded preflop\n- Hand 81: Called 187 (big call)\n- Hand 82: Called 16, then bet 32 on flop\n- Hand 83: Folded preflop\n- Hand 84: Called 16, folded on flop\n- Hand 86: Folded preflop\n- Hand 88: Raised preflop to 64\n\nShowdowns show they've had strong hands: AA multiple times, 77.\n\nThis opponent seems to be fairly active and has shown they can raise preflop. With my short stack, if I call 16, I'll have 66 chips left (2 BB). If I raise to 64, I'll have 18 chips left.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith T2o and a stack of 2.6 BB, this is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting pot odds (calling 16 to win 48, so 3:1), my hand has very poor equity against any reasonable range. \n\nThe only consideration might be if I want to shove all-in as a steal, but:\n1. My hand is too weak\n2. The BB has shown they can call/raise preflop\n3. I only have 2.6 BB, so it's not much pressure\n\n\n4. In a tournament, preserving these chips is crucial for a better opportunity\n\nI'll conserve my limited chips, waiting for a more favorable situation to make a move. The risk-reward ratio simply doesn't justify playing this hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB with K-10 offsuit\n- My stack: 50 chips (1.6 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) is the only active player who called from SB\n- My legal actions: fold, check, or raise to 64 (all-in)\n\n**Stack analysis:**\n- I have 50 chips left, which is less than the minimum raise amount (64)\n- This means if I want to raise, I can only go all-in for my remaining 50 chips\n- Since I posted 32 as BB, I have 18 chips remaining (50 - 32 = 18)\n\nWait, let me recalculate: I posted BB of 32, and I started with 50 chips, so I have 18 chips left. But the pot shows 64 (32 from me + 16 from SB + 16 from SB's call). Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the actions:\n- Seat 4 posted SB 16\n- Seat 1 (me) posted BB 32\n- Seat 4 called 16 (completing the call to match my BB)\n\nSo the pot is 16 (SB) + 32 (my BB) + 16 (call) = 64.\n\nAnd I have 50 - 32 = 18 chips remaining.\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- K-10 offsuit is a decent hand, especially when I'm very short stacked\n- It's well ahead of random hands\n- From BB, I get to see a free flop if I check\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- They call from SB position (hand 82, 84) and then bet on flop or fold\n- They raise preflop from SB position (hand 72, 76, 79, 88)\n- When they raise, it's usually to 32 or 64\n- They seem to be active and aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm extremely short stacked at 1.6 BB\n- The pot is already 64 chips\n- I only have 18 chips left\n- This is a clear all-in or fold situation\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Terrible option. I'd be left with 18 chips and the BB would still be 32 next hand, so I'd be forced all-in anyway.\n\n\n2. **Check**: I can see a free flop with K-10, but with only 18 chips left, I'll be pot-committed on any flop\n3. **Raise (all-in)**: Go all-in for my remaining 18 chips\n\nI'll go all-in to maximize my fold equity and protect my hand. With such a short stack, this is my best chance to double up or force a fold. The pot odds make this a mathematically sound decision, and my K-10 is strong enough to justify the risk.\n\nThe all-in move gives me two ways to win: either my opponent folds, or I have the best hand.

I'm extremely short-stacked with only 3.1 BB\n2. I have a terrible hand (J-2 suited)\n3. I'm on the button which is good position\n4. The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with 718 chips (big stack)\n5. I have to call 16 chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Frequently folds preflop (hands 73, 75, 78, 80, 83, 86, 90)\n- Sometimes raises (hands 76, 79, 88)\n- Sometimes calls (hands 81, 82, 84, 90)\n- Generally seems to play somewhat tight/standard\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith only 3.1 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to find spots to either:\n1. Shove all-in with a decent hand\n2. Steal blinds when possible\n3. Preserve my stack for a better opportunity\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\nJ-2 suited is a terrible hand. Even in position, this is not a hand I want to invest chips with. The only redeeming quality is that it's suited, but the ranks are too low.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 48, I need to call 16. That's 3:1 pot odds. But with my stack size and hand strength, this is not relevant - I should either fold or shove, not call.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 3.1 BB and J-2 suited, this is a clear fold. I need to preserve my tiny stack for a much better spot. Even though I'm on the button and could try to steal, the hand is just too weak. I should wait for at least a decent hand (any pair, any Ace, any two Broadway cards, or at least one high card with connectivity).\n\nThe only argument for playing would be if I think the big blind folds very often, but even then, J-2 is too weak to risk 16% of my stack on a steal attempt when I could find a much better spot.",

I need to consider:\n\n**Hand strength**: Ad 3s is marginal. It's an ace, but with a weak kicker. Against a random hand, it has about 55-60% equity. Against a typical raising range, it's much worse.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 96, getting 3:1 odds. That's 25% equity needed to break even.\n\n**Stack preservation**: With 2.1 BB, I'm in critical territory. However, I also need to take spots to double up.\n\n**Opponent tendency**: MiniMax-M2 has shown they can raise from SB (did it in hand #88). They have a big stack and can apply pressure.\n\n**Tournament situation**: With such a short stack, I should be looking for spots to get all-in. However, Ad 3s is not a great hand to do it with, especially against a raise from the opponent.\n \nI recognize the critical nature of my chip situation. The 3:1 pot odds are mathematically tempting, but my extremely short stack demands caution. Calling would commit nearly half my remaining chips, leaving me critically vulnerable on the flop. \n\nWith a marginal ace and limited chips, the strategic move is to fold. This preserves my last 34 chips, buying me time to find a better opportunity to push all-in with a stronger hand or more favorable position. The risk of being dominated by a better ace or strong pocket pair makes this fold the most prudent tournament survival strategy.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my situation:\n- I have Kc 3s on the button\n- My stack is only 50 chips (1.6 BB) - I'm extremely short-stacked\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- I'm in the SB position (seat 1) but it says I'm BTN (button) - this seems inconsistent, but the blinds show I posted 16 as SB\n- I need to call 16 to complete the BB (since I posted SB)\n- Pot is 48 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 is in BB with 766 chips (big stack)\n\nFrom the opponent analysis:\nMiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 73, 75, 78, 80, 83, 86)\n- Raising sometimes (hands 76, 79, 88, 92) - usually to 32 or 64\n- Calling occasionally (hands 81, 82, 84, 90)\n- When they call preflop, they often bet on the flop (hand 82) or fold on flop (hands 77, 84)\n\nGiven my situation:\n1. I'm extremely short-stacked with only 1.6 BB\n2. I have K3o - a very weak hand\n3. I need to call 16 to see a flop, which would leave me with only 34 chips\n4. The pot is 48, giving me 3:1 immediate pot odds\n5. As a short stack, I need to be looking for spots to get my money in with decent equity\n\nWith K3o, even against a random hand, I have about 45-50% equity. But I'm out of position against the big stack.\n\nThe key consideration: I'm down to 1.6 BB. In tournament poker, when you're this short, you often need to take any decent spot to shove or call. However, K3o is really weak, and I'd be calling off 32% of my stack (16/50) just to see a flop out of position.\n\nThe better play here is to fold and wait for a better spot. \n\nI'll preserve my remaining 50 chips for a more favorable opportunity. With such a short stack, every chip is precious, and risking 32% on a marginal hand like K3o isn't strategically sound. I'll maintain my patience and look for a stronger hand or better position to make my move.",

Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm extremely short-stacked at 1.6 BB. This is critical tournament situation.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in BB with 766 chips (big stack). Looking at their recent actions:\n   - They've been active: folding, calling, raising\n   - They've made preflop raises of 64 chips (2x BB) in hands 88 and 92\n   - They seem to defend their BB sometimes but also fold to pressure\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1 odds). This might seem tempting with a short stack, but...\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With only 1.6 BB, I need to be very selective. While I could call and see a flop, if I miss (very likely with J4o), I'll be left with just 34 chips and still in terrible position.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with such a weak hand and short stack, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and I'm extremely short, J4 offsuit has such poor equity that it's not worth the risk. I need to preserve my last 50 chips for a better spot - ideally when I can be the aggressor with a stronger hand or when I have better pot odds preflop. Calling here would leave me with 34 chips and still needing to hit a miracle flop.\n\nFolding keeps my 50 chips intact for a better opportunity.",

I'm extremely short-stacked with only 18 chips left (0.6 BB)\n2. I have a terrible hand: 5c 3c (offsuit, low cards)\n3. The pot is already 64 chips\n4. I can check for free (amount to call is 0)\n5. MiniMax-M2 is the only active opponent with a healthy stack of 782 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data, I see MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 83, 86, 94)\n- Calling sometimes (hands 84, 90)\n- Raising occasionally (hands 88, 92)\n\nThis suggests they're playing relatively tight but not extremely so.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 5c 3c is terrible - only about 30-35% equity against a random hand\n2. **Stack size**: I'm desperate with 0.6 BB left\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 64 and I can see the flop for free\n4. **Tournament situation**: I need to make a move soon or I'll blind out\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I can check and see a free flop, hoping to hit something\n- Even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated\n- However, with my stack size, any pair might be worth shoving on the flop\n- The pot is already 64 chips, and I only have 18 left - if I win, I triple up\n\n**My thought process:**\nGiven that I can see the flop for free and I'm extremely short-stacked, checking makes sense. Even with a terrible hand, I need to take any free opportunity to potentially win chips. If I fold, I lose 32 chips (the BB I posted) and will be in even worse shape next hand with only 18 chips left.\n\nThe risk is minimal (it's free to check), and the potential reward is significant (winning a 64 chip pot would triple my stack).\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The board has a Q and 7, with two diamonds. I have a weak hand with no real draw. I have a backdoor flush draw (need two more clubs) but that's very weak.\n\n**My stack situation:**\nI'm extremely short with only 18 chips (0.6 BB). The pot is 64 chips, which is more than 3x my stack. This is a classic situation where I should be looking to get my money in, but I need to consider if checking is the right move.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 is the only active opponent. Looking at their history:\n- They've been fairly active preflop with raises and calls\n- They tend to fold on the flop when they don't connect (hands 77, 82, 84)\n- They posted SB and called preflop, then I checked\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith 0.6 BB left, I'm in a critical situation. I need to find spots to double up or I'm going to blind out. The pot is already 64 chips, which would more than triple me up to ~82 chips if I win.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a weak hand (bottom pair with bad kicker), but I'm getting a free look at the turn.

But for now, checking is the right play to see a free card.\n\nThe correct action is to check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5c 3c - I have bottom pair (5s) on a board of 7d 5d Qh. This is very weak.\n2. **My stack**: 18 chips (0.6 BB) - I'm extremely short stacked.\n3. **Position**: BB (out of position)\n4. **Board**: 7d 5d Qh - Two diamonds, so a flush draw is possible. I have bottom pair with a weak kicker.\n5. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) bet 32 into a 96 pot. I need to call 32.\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 96, I need to call 32, so 3:1 pot odds. If I call, I have 0 chips left (18-32 would be negative).\n\nWait, let me recalculate. The pot is 96 before the bet. MiniMax bet 32, making the pot 128. I need to call 32 to win 128, which is 4:1 pot odds. But I only have 18 chips, so I can't even make the call - I'd have to go all-in for 18.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes again - I have 18 chips. The bet is 32. I cannot call 32. My only options are fold or go all-in for 18. But the legal actions shown are just \"fold, call\" - this suggests I can call 18 (all-in).\n\nLet me think about MiniMax's tendencies from the history:\n- Hand 82: Flop bet 32 (similar to this hand)\n- Hand 84: Preflop call 16, then flop fold\n- Hand 88: Preflop raise 64\n- Hand 90: Preflop call 16, then fold\n- Hand 92: Preflop raise 64\n\nMiniMax seems to be playing fairly aggressively preflop with raises, and making continuation bets on the flop.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have bottom pair with a terrible kicker\n- I'm extremely short stacked (0.6 BB)\n- I'm out of position\n- There's a possible flush draw and I could be drawing dead to many hands\n- I have no fold equity since I'd be calling all-in\n\nEven with 4:1 pot odds, I don't think calling with bottom pair and no kicker is profitable here. I'm likely behind to any Q, any 7, any pocket pair, any diamond draw, etc. The only hands I'm ahead of are pure bluffs or hands like A-high.\n\nWith such a short stack, I should be looking for much better spots. This is a clear fold.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider - I only have 18 chips left. The pot is 128. If I go all-in for 18, I'm getting about 7:1 on my money. But I'm almost certainly behind. Let me think about what hands I could be ahead of:\n- A pure bluff (but why bluff when I have so few chips?)\n- A smaller pair (but there are no smaller pairs than 5s except maybe 2s, 3s, or 4s)\n- Ace-high\n\nI'm behind to:\n- Any pair of 7s or Qs\n- Any diamond draw (which has many outs)\n- Any hand with a 5 and better kicker\n- Any overpair\n\nGiven the texture and the opponent's bet, I think I'm beat way too often. This is a fold.\n\nWait, I should double-check my stack. The prompt says \"Your Stack: 18 chips (0.6 BB)\" and blinds are 16/32. 18 chips is indeed less than 1 big blind. I'm in a very desperate situation.\n\nBut even in desperate situations, I need to make good decisions. With bottom pair and no kicker on this board, I'm not in good shape. The opponent's bet of 32 into 96 is a small bet (1/3 pot), which could be a value bet with a strong hand or a c-bet with air.\n\nGiven my extreme short stack, some might argue for going all-in here to maximize fold equity and take advantage of pot odds. But I have NO fold equity - the opponent has already bet, and calling 18 more into a pot of 128 is trivial for them if they have any piece.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot, even though my stack is tiny. With 5c 3c, I don't even have a good chance of improving - I have 2 outs to trips (the remaining 5s), and that's it. If I'm against a flush draw, they have 9 outs. If I'm against a better pair, I have 2 outs. If I'm against two pair or a set, I'm drawing dead.\n\nThis is a fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB with 5c 3c\n- Flop: 7d 5d Qh\n- I have bottom pair (5s)\n- My stack: 18 chips (very short, less than 1 BB)\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) bet 32\n- I need to call 32, but I only have 18 chips total\n\n**Key points:**\n1. I have bottom pair with a weak kicker\n2. There's a flush draw on board (2 diamonds)\n3. My stack is extremely short (18 chips, which is 0.6 BB)\n4. I cannot even afford the full call of 32 - I can only go all-in for 18\n5. The pot is already 96, so I'm getting great pot odds if I could call\n\n**Analysis:**\n- With 18 chips left and the pot at 96, if I could call 32, I'd be getting 3:1 pot odds\n- But I can only put in 18 chips total, so I'd be calling 18 to win 96 (5.33:1 odds)\n- I have bottom pair which might be good, but could easily be behind\n- The Q on board could easily have hit my opponent\n- There's a flush draw I don't have\n\n**Decision:**\nSince I can only fold or call (can't raise), and I have bottom pair with such a short stack, I need to think about tournament survival vs. chip accumulation.\n\nActually, wait - I need to re-read. The amount to call is 32, but I only have 18 chips. In poker, when you don't have enough to call a full bet, you can go all-in. So my options are:\n- Fold\n- Call all-in for my remaining 18 chips\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have some equity with bottom pair\n2. The pot is already 96 chips\n3. I'm extremely short-stacked and need to make a move soon\n4. I'm getting ~5.3:1 on my money\n\nBut also:\n- My hand is very weak (bottom pair, bad kicker)\n- There's a Q on board which likely hits opponent's range\n- There's a flush draw\n\nI think this is a fold. I have very little equity with bottom pair, and even though I'm short, I should wait for a better spot. The Q is very scary, and I could easily be drawing to 5 outs (two more 5s) at best, or could already be drawing dead.\n\n\nI'll fold this hand, preserving my minimal stack for a more promising opportunity. The risk outweighs the potential gain with such a weak holding.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3s Th - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a low kicker.\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but with my tiny stack it doesn't matter much.\n3. **My stack**: 2 chips (0.1 BB) - This is critically short, almost nothing left.\n4. **Blinds**: 16/32 - The big blind is 32 chips\n5. **Pot**: 48 chips\n6. **Amount to call**: 16 chips (to complete my small blind)\n7. **Legal actions**: fold, call (no raise option)\n\nGiven that I have 2 chips and need to call 16, I actually can't afford to call. The system says \"Amount to call: 16\" but I only have 2 chips. This means I would be all-in if I call.\n\nLet me think about the pot odds:\n- Pot is 48 chips\n- I need to put in my remaining 2 chips\n- Pot odds: 48:2 or 24:1\n\nWith 3s Th, this is a terrible hand. However, with my stack being so short (0.1 BB), and the pot odds being 24:1, I need to consider if it's worth taking a chance.\n\nLet me check the opponent's behavior:\n- MiniMax-M2 is in the BB with 814 chips (deep stack)\n- Looking at their preflop actions: they fold a lot, call sometimes, and raise occasionally\n- They seem to be a fairly straightforward player\n\nWith my hand of 3s Th:\n- Very low chance of winning\n- I'm almost certainly dominated by any hand that calls\n- Even with 24:1 pot odds, this hand is just too weak\n\nHowever, I have a critical stack situation:\n- I have 0.1 BB left\n- If I fold, I'll have 2 chips and be in the BB next hand where I'll have to put in 32 chips (which I don't have)\n- This means if I fold, I'll be all-in next hand anyway in the BB\n\nSo my choices are:\n1. Fold now, then be forced all-in next hand in BB with random cards\n2. Call now with 3s Th and be all-in\n\nGiven that I'll be all-in next hand anyway, and the pot odds are 24:1, I should probably call now and take my chances with 3s Th.\n \nI realize the tournament situation demands immediate action. With an extremely short stack and mandatory all-in scenarios in both current and next hands, calling now seems mathematically prudent. The marginal difference between folding and calling is negligible given my dire chip position. Taking the 24:1 pot odds with my current hand represents the most strategic option, despite the hand's inherent weakness.\n\nI'll commit my remaining chips and hope for the best possible outcome, recognizing this is likely my final hand of the tournament.",

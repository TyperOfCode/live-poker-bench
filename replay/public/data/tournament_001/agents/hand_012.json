I'd be calling 8 chips with poor equity (~30-35% vs typical raising ranges) and would be out of position post-flop. With 184.5 BB, I can wait for better spots.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Qc 5c (Queen of clubs, 5 of clubs) - This is a suited but weak hand. Q5s is not a strong starting hand, especially in early position. I'm in CO (Cutoff), which is late position, but this is still a marginal hand.\n\n**Stack**: 369 chips (184.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Position**: CO (Cutoff) - Good position, but there are players behind me (BTN and possibly blinds).\n\n**Action**: \n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Let me check what I learned about GPT-OSS-120B from the recall. Looking at their actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 all folded)\n- They raised to 4 in hand 5 preflop\n- They called and folded on later streets in hand 5\n- They folded on turn in hand 4\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B appears to be relatively tight, folding most hands preflop. The fact that they're raising now to 8 (which is 4x the BB) suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11 (already in pot) + 8 (their raise) = 19 chips. So 8/19 = ~42% pot odds needed.\n\n**Hand Equity**: Q5s against a typical raising range (like 88+, ATs+, KJs+, AJo+, KQo) has roughly 30-35% equity. This is worse than the pot odds I'm getting.\n\n**Position**: Even though I'm in CO, I still have players behind me who could 3-bet. And if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser post-flop.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack of 184.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. \n\nThe hand's potential is severely limited. Suited connectors offer minimal upside with Q5s, and I'm likely dominated by stronger queen or higher card combinations. Facing a raise from a tight player in a multi-player scenario, the risk significantly outweighs any potential reward. Folding is the most prudent decision to protect my chip stack and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Th - This is a very weak hand. T3 offsuit is one of the worst possible starting hands. It has almost no playability post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is great position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Opponent behavior**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 (4x BB). Looking at their history, they've folded preflop in most recent hands (Hands 6-11 all folded preflop). In Hand #5, they raised preflop to 4 (2x BB). So this is only the second time they've raised preflop. This might indicate a stronger hand than their usual range.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 to win 11, which gives me ~1.57:1 pot odds (about 39% equity needed). With T3o, I have nowhere near that equity against a raising range.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 249 chips (124.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has 143 chips (71.5 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2 has only 47 chips (23.5 BB) in the BB - very short stack\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a good stack and should preserve it. Calling with T3o would be speculative at best and likely burning chips.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The short stack in the BB (MiniMax-M2) might be forced to go all-in with many hands given their stack size of only 47 chips. If they shove, the pot gets bigger but I'd still have a terrible hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (T3o)\n- I need ~39% equity but likely have <20% against a raising range\n- Opponent has shown some aggression (raised preflop)\n- I have position but hand is too weak to leverage it\n- Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. Even though I'm on the button, T3o is simply not playable for a raise, especially when I'd be out of position relative to the raiser (they act after me post-flop).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T3o is too weak to call a 4x raise. Need ~39% equity but have <20% against raising range. Opponent has shown recent aggression. Better to preserve stack for better spots.\"\n}",

Preflop: seat 3 posted small blind 1, seat 4 posted big blind 2. So we are first to act UTG (seat5). Amount to call 2, min raise to 4.\n\nWe need to decide: raise or call? Call would just call 2 (i.e., limp) which is rarely good UTG with AJ suited. Raise is standard. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 short stack (47 chips) may be willing to shove or call all-in. Their raise patterns: they raised to 4 (min) in hand 4 and 9, also raised larger amounts 20,28. So they are aggressive. As we raise, they may either call or shove all-in. But we have decent stack. Raising to 4 (i.e., 2 raise) is small; maybe we should raise to 6 (standard 3x BB) or 8? Minimum raise to 4 is only 2 more chips. But typical raise size is 3-4 BB, i.e., 6-8 chips. Since we have deep stack, we can raise to maybe 8. Legal actions allow raise to any amount up to stack. We should raise to 8 (total). Reason: open-raise with AJ suited from UTG is strong, want to build pot and isolate, also protect against being raised all-in later. Also short stack may shove, but we can call.\n\nThus decision: raise to 8.\n\nCheck if any other opponent might fold. Good.\n\nProvide JSON.",

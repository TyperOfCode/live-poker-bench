            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand:** 5c 5h (pocket fives)\n**Position:** Button\n**Stack:** 353 chips (5.5 BB)\n**Blinds:** 32/64\n**Pot:** 272 chips\n**Action:** Seat 3 (SB) posted 32, then raised to 208\n**Amount to call:** 144 chips\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\nWait, I need to reconsider the chip counts. It says Seat 3 has 32 chips and posted SB of 32. If they posted 32 as SB, they'd have 0 left. But then they raised to 208. This seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Perhaps the \"32 chips\" is their stack AFTER posting the SB? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". This suggests they have 32 chips total and posted 32 as SB. Then the raise to 208 must be an error in the data, OR it means they're raising to 208 total which would be all their chips (32) plus something else? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me reconsider: perhaps the \"32 chips\" shown is their stack size at the start of the hand, they posted SB of 32 (leaving them with 0), and the raise to 208 is actually what they're raising TO, but they can only put in 32 total. So effectively they're all-in for 32.\n\nBut the amount to call is shown as 144. If the SB posted 32 and then raised to 208, that means they're raising 176 more (208-32 = 176). But they only have 32 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me try another interpretation: The \"32 chips\" shown for Seat 3 might be incorrect or outdated. If they raised to 208, they must have at least 208 chips. The amount to call is 144, which is 208 - 64 (my BB). \n\nActually, I should just focus on the key facts:\n\n\nI'm facing a critical decision with a short stack and pocket fives. The pot is substantial at 272 chips, but calling 144 chips represents a significant portion of my remaining 353-chip stack. With a tight opponent raising from the small blind, this becomes a high-risk, marginal spot. The hand history suggests my opponent plays conservatively, making their raise more meaningful. Given my limited stack and the unfavorable pot odds, folding appears to be the most prudent decision to preserve my tournament life.\n\nThe tight player's range likely includes higher pairs and strong aces, which puts my pocket fives at a distinct disadvantage. With only 5.5 big blinds remaining, I need to be extremely selective about my confrontations. The potential risk outweighs the potential reward in this scenario.\n\nMy stack size suggests a shove or fold strategy, and calling with a marginal hand like pocket fives doesn't align with optimal short-stack play. The pot odds are not compelling enough to justify risking a significant portion of my remaining chips.\n\nI need to preserve my limited stack for a more favorable opportunity, making a fold the most prudent decision in this situation.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 64. Seat 2 folded. So it's heads-up between me (BB) and Seat 1 (SB). I need to call 32 more to complete the BB (since I already posted 32 as SB? Wait, I'm Seat 3, BB position, but the actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 32\" and \"Seat 1 post_bb 64\". That seems reversed: I should be BB posting 64, but it says I posted SB 32. Maybe the positions are labeled differently? Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So I'm BB, but action says \"Seat 3 post_sb 32\". Possibly a mislabel? Actually in some tournaments, BB posts the big blind and SB posts small blind. So Seat 1 is SB, posted 32, I'm BB posted 64. But the action says \"Seat 3 post_sb 32\" and \"Seat 1 post_bb 64\". That's confusing.\n\nLet me think: Players: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 353 chips, Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 278 chips (folded), Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (me) - 208 chips, Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded), Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded). So there are 5 seats but two are empty (0 chips folded). So only three active players: Seat 1, Seat 2, and me. Seat 2 folded preflop. So it's heads-up between Seat 1 (SB) and me (BB). The pot is 96 chips: SB 32 + BB 64. I have already posted BB 64? Wait, \"Amount to call: 32\". That suggests I need to call 32 more. That means I have only put in 32 so far? But I'm BB, I should have put in 64. Actually, maybe the SB is 32, BB is 64. I'm BB, so I should have put 64. But amount to call is 32, meaning I have already put 32? That would be if I posted SB, not BB. The text says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but also \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". That seems contradictory. Could be a bug in display. Anyway, the situation: pot is 96, I need to call 32 to see a flop heads-up against SB. My stack is 208 chips. If I call, I'll have 176 left (208-32). If I raise, minimum raise to 128 total (so additional 96 raise). That would be a raise of 96 more on top of the 32 call? Actually minimum raise to 128 total means I need to put 128 total. I've already put 32? Wait, I need to figure out what I've already contributed.\n\nLet's assume I'm BB and have posted 64. Then amount to call would be 0 because SB posted 32 and it's my turn? But amount to call is 32. So maybe I'm SB and posted 32, and SB acts first? Actually SB acts first preflop, but after folds, SB can raise or complete. Then BB can raise or check. But here it's showing amount to call 32, meaning SB raised? No, there's no raise indicated. Let's examine actions: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\", \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64\", \"preflop: Seat 2 fold\". So Seat 3 (me) posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. That means I'm SB, not BB. But the header says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". That's a discrepancy. Possibly a mislabel. I'll trust the actions: I posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. So I'm SB, Seat 1 is BB. Then Seat 2 folded. So action is on me (SB) to complete the blind (call 32 more) or raise. Yes, that makes sense: I posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB's 64. So I have 208 chips, posted 32, so 176 left. If I call 32 more, I'll have 144 left. If I raise"

But I'm BB, I should have put in 64. Actually, maybe the SB is 32, BB is 64. I'm BB, so I should have put 64. But amount to call is 32, meaning I have already put 32? That would be if I posted SB, not BB. The text says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but also \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". That seems contradictory. Could be a bug in display. Anyway, the situation: pot is 96, I need to call 32 to see a flop heads-up against SB. My stack is 208 chips. If I call, I'll have 176 left (208-32). If I raise, minimum raise to 128 total (so additional 96 raise). That would be a raise of 96 more on top of the 32 call? Actually minimum raise to 128 total means I need to put 128 total. I've already put 32? Wait, I need to figure out what I've already contributed.\n\nLet's assume I'm BB and have posted 64. Then amount to call would be 0 because SB posted 32 and it's my turn? But amount to call is 32. So maybe I'm SB and posted 32, and SB acts first? Actually SB acts first preflop, but after folds, SB can raise or complete. Then BB can raise or check. But here it's showing amount to call 32, meaning SB raised? No, there's no raise indicated. Let's examine actions: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\", \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64\", \"preflop: Seat 2 fold\". So Seat 3 (me) posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. That means I'm SB, not BB. But the header says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". That's a discrepancy. Possibly a mislabel. I'll trust the actions: I posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. So I'm SB, Seat 1 is BB. Then Seat 2 folded. So action is on me (SB) to complete the blind (call 32 more) or raise. Yes, that makes sense: I posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB's 64. So I have 208 chips, posted 32, so 176 left. If I call 32 more, I'll have 144 left. If I raise",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. Let me analyze the hand properly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. I'm in the BB according to the header, but actions show Seat 3 (me) posted SB 32, and Seat 1 posted BB 64. This is confusing. Let me check the table setup: 5 seats, but seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So only 3 players: Seat 1 (353 chips), Seat 2 (278 chips, folded), and me Seat 3 (208 chips). Blinds are 32/64.\n\nThe actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32, Seat 1 post_bb 64, Seat 2 fold. So I posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. That means I'm SB, Seat 1 is BB. But the header says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". That's contradictory. However, the \"Amount to call: 32\" makes sense if I'm SB: I've posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB's 64.\n\nThus, I'm SB with 9c9d, stack 208 chips (3.2 BB). I've already posted 32, so I have 176 left. Pot is 96 (32+64). It's heads-up against BB. I need to decide: fold, call 32, or raise to at least 128 total.\n\nMy hand: pocket 9s is a decent hand, especially heads-up. With only 3.2 BB effective stack (my stack is 208, BB is 64, so 3.25 BB actually). Actually, my stack is 208, BB is 64, so I have 3.25 BB. That's extremely short-stacked. Pocket 9s is a premium hand with such a short stack. I should be looking to get all-in preflop.\n\nBut let's consider: if I raise, minimum raise to 128 total. That would be putting 128 total, meaning I raise 96 more (since I've already put 32). That would leave me with 80 chips (208-128). Then BB could call or raise. If BB calls, pot would be 256 (96+96+64? Let's calculate: my raise to 128 total, BB has already put 64, needs to call additional 64 to match my 128. So pot would be 128+128=256). If BB raises, I'd have to call remaining 80 chips.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should probably go all-in. But legal actions don't include all-in? Actually, I can raise to any amount up to my stack. Minimum raise to 128, but I can raise more, up to 208 (my total stack). With pocket 9s and 3.25 BB, going all-in is standard.\n\nBut let me think about opponent tendencies. I should use tools to recall opponent actions. Let me search for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) behavior. Use recall_opponent_actions.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. But first I should analyze the hand properly. Let me think through the situation without using tools since the system is complaining about format.\n\nI have 9c9d. Stack is 208 chips (3.2 BB). Blinds 32/64. Pot is 96. I need to call 32. Minimum raise to 128 total. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'm likely in SB position based on actions (posted SB 32). Opponent in BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 353 chips.\n\nWith pocket 9s, this is a strong hand heads-up. My stack is short (3.2 BB). In tournament poker with short stack, pocket 9s is a premium hand. I should be looking to get all-in preflop. Folding is not an option. Calling is okay but raising is better to build pot and potentially take it down preflop.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise to 128 total. That would be putting 128 total, meaning I raise 96 more on top of the 32 I already posted? Actually I've posted 32 SB, so to raise to 128 total, I need to put 96 more (32+96=128). That leaves me with 112 chips (208-96). That's a significant portion of my stack. Alternatively, I could go all-in for 208 total. But legal actions only show raise, not all-in specifically. But I can raise to any amount up to my stack. Minimum raise to 128, maximum 208.\n\nGiven my short stack, pushing all-in is standard with 99. The opponent has me covered. If I raise to 128, I'm committing more than half my stack anyway, so might as well go all-in to maximize fold equity and avoid playing postflop with awkward stack.\n\nBut let me consider: if I raise to 128, opponent might call or raise. If they call, pot will be 128 (my raise) + 64 (their BB) + 32 (my SB) = 224? Wait recalc: Pot currently 96 (32 SB + 64 BB). If I raise to 128 total, I put 96 more (since I already put 32). Total pot becomes 96 + 96 = 192. Opponent needs to call 64 more (128 total - 64 they already put). So pot would be 192 + 64 = 256 if they call. I'd have 112 left behind. That's awkward for postflop play.\n\nBetter to go all-in for 208 total. That's a raise of 176 more (208-32). Pot would be 96 + 176 = 272. Opponent needs to call 144 more (208-64). They have 353 chips, so they can call.\n\nWith 99 and 3.2 BB stack, all-in is correct. Let me check if there are any tournament considerations. We're in a tournament, short stack. Need to accumulate chips. 99 is strong enough to go all-in.\n\nI'll go all-in. Let me structure the JSON response.",

Let me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a marginal hand, especially facing 3-bets. It's dominated by many hands (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, A8, A7). The suitedness helps but it's still weak.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good position, but I'm facing aggression from both blinds.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: No history available, so I have to assume standard play.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 69 chips, I need to call 39, so I'm getting about 1.77:1 odds. This isn't great for a marginal hand.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I'm in decent shape.

The action: Seat 1 raised to 6 (3x BB), then Seat 2 (small blind) 3-bet to 18 (9x BB). The pot is 26 chips currently (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 + 18 - but actually let me calculate: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat 1 raised to 6 total, Seat 2 raised to 18 total. So pot is 1+2+6+18=27 chips? Wait, the system says pot is 26 chips. Maybe Seat 2's raise is to 18 total, which means additional 17? Actually Seat 2 posted SB 1, then raised to 18 total, so additional 17. Seat 1 raised to 6 total, which is additional 4 from his position. So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + Seat 1's 6 + Seat 2's 17 = 26. Yes.\n\nI need to call 16 chips to match Seat 2's bet. My stack is 198, so calling 16 is about 8% of my stack. I have pocket kings, which is the second-best starting hand. However, there's a 3-bet from the small blind after an initial raise from UTG (Seat 1). This could indicate strong hands.\n\nI have no history on these opponents from the tools. They appear to be AI players (Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2). Given this is a tournament, I need to consider stack preservation vs. accumulation.\n\nWith pocket kings, I should definitely not fold. I could call or raise. If I raise, minimum raise to is 30 total (additional 12 from the 18 I need to call? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet to me is 18 total. Minimum raise would be to 30 total (18 + 12). My legal actions include raise, so I can raise.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand, I should consider a 4-bet. Standard would be to raise to around 40-50 total. However, I need to consider stack sizes: I have 198, Seat 1 has 194, Seat 2 has 182. If I raise to say 45 total, that's a significant portion of stacks (about 22% of my stack). If I get 5-bet all-in, I would likely call with kings.\n\nBut there's also the possibility Seat 2 has aces. However, with kings, I should be willing to get all-in preflop. The pot is already 26, and raising could build a bigger pot.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 26, which is about 1.6:1 odds, requiring ~38% equity. Kings have much higher equity against most ranges. Against a range of JJ+, AK, kings have ~70% equity. Even against AA, KK, AK, kings have ~55% equity (but actually against AA only, kings have ~18% equity). But the chance of opponent having aces is low (1/221).\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I want to build a pot with my strong hand. I'll 4-bet to around 45-50 total.\n\nLet me decide: I'll raise to 45 total. That means I put in 45 chips total (I already have 2 in as BB, so additional 43). This is a reasonable 4-bet size.\n\nJSON response.",

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI have pocket kings, a premium hand. Seat 2 (SB) re-raised after Seat 1's raise. This is a 3-bet situation. I should consider raising (4-bet) with kings.

With pocket kings, I want to build a pot. The current pot is 26 chips (1+2+6+18? Let's calculate: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat 1 raised to 6, Seat 2 raised to 18. So pot = 1+2+6+18 = 27? Actually Seat 2's raise includes his SB of 1, so total from him is 18 (includes 1 SB). So pot = 2 (BB) + 6 (Seat 1) + 18 (Seat 2) = 26 chips. Yes.\n\nIf I call 16 more, pot becomes 42.

My stack is 198, so I can afford a sizable raise.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent ranges: Seat 1 raised, Seat 2 3-bet. Seat 2 could have strong hands: AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ. I have KK, so only AA beats me. I should try to get value from QQ, AK, etc. Raising also protects against AA if they 5-bet shove.\n\nI should raise. Let's decide raise size. Minimum raise to 30 total (raise additional 28 from my current 2? Wait: I've already put 2 in BB. To raise to 30 total, I need to put 28 more (30 total). But minimum raise is from 18 to 30 (increase of 12). Actually the rule: minimum raise is the size of the previous raise. Previous raise was from 6 to 18 (increase of 12). So minimum raise is to 30 total (18+12). So I can raise to 30 total, putting in 28 more (since I already have 2). That's a small 4-bet. Might be okay but could invite calls. I could raise larger to 40-50 total.\n\nBut I need to consider tournament strategy: with 99 BB, I can afford to play a big pot with kings. I'll raise to 45 total (putting in 43 more).

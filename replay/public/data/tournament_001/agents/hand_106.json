Let me parse the details:\n\n- Hand #106 - PREFLOP\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: Qd Jd (Queen of diamonds, Jack of diamonds)\n- Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 224 chips\n\nPlayers:\n- Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 11 chips (this is us)\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 364 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 336 chips (folded)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\n\nActions this hand:\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64\n- preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n\nAmount to call: 64\nMinimum raise to: 192\nLegal actions: fold, call\n\nWait, there's something inconsistent here. Let me re-read:\n\n\"Blinds: 32/64\" - So small blind is 32, big blind is 64.\n\n\"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - 11 chips is way less than 1 big blind (64 chips). This means we're extremely short-stacked.\n\nBut then it says \"Pot: 224 chips\" - how can the pot be 224 chips if the blinds are 32/64 and we're the BB with only 11 chips?\n\nLet me trace the actions:\n- Seat 3 (SB) posts 32\n- Seat 1 (BB, us) posts 64 - but we only have 11 chips. This is impossible.\n\nWait, the user says \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - 11 chips is 0.2 of a 64-chip big blind, so 0.2 * 64 = 12.8, close to 11. So yes, we have 11 chips total.\n\nBut then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64\" - we cannot post 64 chips if we only have 11 chips. This is contradictory.\n\nLet me re-read more carefully: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe the BB is 64, but we have 11 chips left AFTER posting? Or maybe the tournament uses different blind structure?\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a typo or the blinds are in a different unit. Let me look at the pot size: \"Pot: 224 chips\"\n\nIf blinds are 32/64:\n- SB posts 32\n- BB posts 64\nTotal from blinds = 96 chips\n\nBut the pot is 224 chips, which is much larger. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\" - so someone raised to 128.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- SB posts 32\n- BB posts 64\n- Seat 2 raises to 128 (this is a raise of 64 over the BB of 64)\n\nIf everyone calls, the pot would be:\n- SB: 32\n- BB: 64\n- Seat 2: 128\nTotal: 224 chips\n\nAh! So \"Pot: 224 chips\" is the current pot size AFTER the raise to 128 and before any action from us.\n\nNow, \"Amount to call: 64\" - we posted 64 as BB, and someone raised to 128, so we need to put in 64 more to call.\n\nBut wait: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - we only have 11 chips total. We cannot call 64 chips.\n\nThis is extremely contradictory. Let me think about what could be happening:\n\n1. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a mistake and we actually have more\n2. Maybe the \"0.2 BB\" is a mistake and we have more chips\n3. Maybe the blind structure is different than I think\n4. Maybe this is a tournament where the BB is 5 chips or something, making 11 chips = 0.2 BB\n\nLet me look at the numbers again:\n- If BB is 64, then 0.2 BB = 0.2 * 64 = 12.8 chips\n- If we have 11 chips, that's roughly 0.17 BB\n\nBut the user explicitly says \"Blinds: 32/64\" and \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\".\n\nWait, maybe the \"(0.2 BB)\" is a calculation error by the system, and we actually have more chips"

This means I cannot possibly call - I can only fold or go all-in for my remaining 11 chips if that's an option.\n\nBut the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise/all-in option is listed. However, in poker, if you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for whatever you have left.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The \"Amount to call: 64\" might be a display error, or it might mean I need to put in 64 more chips total (but I only have 11). In reality, if I only have 11 chips, I can go all-in for 11.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 224 chips. This suggests:\n- SB posted 32\n- BB posted 64\n- Seat 2 raised to 128\n- Total: 32 + 64 + 128 = 224\n\nSo the action is on me in the BB. I posted 64, and Seat 2 raised to 128. I need to call 64 more chips to see the flop.\n\nBut I only have 11 chips left after posting the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense either. If I had to post BB of 64, I must have had at least 64 chips to start the hand.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe this means I have 11 big blinds, not 11 chips? No, it says \"11 chips\" and then \"(0.2 BB)\" as a conversion.\n\nI think there might be an error in the hand description. However, I must make a decision based on what's given. Let me assume the key facts are:\n1. I have a very short stack (0.2 BB = very short)\n2. I have Qd Jd in the BB\n3. Someone raised to 128\n4. I need to call 64 more\n5. I only have legal actions: fold, call\n\nGiven that I have Qd Jd, this is a decent hand, especially when short-stacked. From the BB, this is definitely a hand I should play, especially if I can see a flop cheaply relative to my stack.\n\nBut wait - if I truly only have 11 chips and need to call 64, that's impossible. The system must be allowing me to call for my remaining 11 chips (all-in).\n\nLet me think about the tournament situation:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked (0.2 BB)\n- Qd Jd is a strong hand in this spot\n- The pot is already 224 chips\n- If I win, I quadruple up or more\n- Tournament survival is important, but with 0.2 BB, I need to make a move soon\n\nWith Qd Jd, I should definitely go all-in here. It's a premium hand for a short stack, and I have good equity against most ranges.\n\nHowever, the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise option. But if I only have 11 chips and need to call 64, my only realistic option is to go all-in for 11, which should be treated as a call of 11.\n\nLet me make a decision: I should go all-in with Qd Jd here. It's a strong hand, I'm extremely short-stacked, and I need to accumulate chips or go home.\n\nThe reasoning should be: I have a suited connector QJ with good playability, I'm extremely short-stacked at 0.2 BB, and this is a good spot to shove and try to double/triple up.\n\nBut the format requires me to choose from fold, call, or raise. Since raise isn't listed as a legal action, but I need to put in all my chips, I think \"call\" is the appropriate action here (calling for my remaining stack).\n\nActually, let me reconsider: if the amount to call is 64 and I only have 11, I cannot call 64. In poker rules, I would be all-in for 11. The system should allow this as a \"call\" action that puts me all-in.\n\nSo my decision is: call (all-in for my remaining 11 chips).\n\nReasoning: With Qd Jd and only 0.2 BB left, this is"

            "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to respond with a JSON object containing 'action', 'raise_to' (if raising), and 'reasoning'.\n\nLet me analyze the poker hand again:\n\n- I'm in the BB with Qd Jd\n- My stack is 11 chips (0.2 BB)\n- Blinds are 32/64\n- Pot is 224 chips\n- Actions so far: SB posted 32, I posted BB 64, Seat 2 raised to 128, Seat 3 folded\n- Amount to call: 64\n- Legal actions: fold, call\n\nWait, there's a serious problem here. If my stack is 11 chips, I cannot call 64 chips. This is impossible. The system must be allowing me to go all-in for my remaining 11 chips as a \"call\" action.\n\nHowever, the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise option. But if I only have 11 chips and need to call 64, my only realistic option is to go all-in for 11, which should be treated as a call that puts me all-in.\n\nLet me think about the hand:\n- Qd Jd is a decent hand, especially when short-stacked\n- I'm in the BB, so I've already invested 64 chips (but wait, if I only have 11 chips total, how did I post 64?)\n\nI think there might be an error in the hand description. The \"11 chips\" might be a mistake, or the \"0.2 BB\" might be a mistake. Let me assume the key facts are:\n1. I have a very short stack (0.2 BB)\n2. I have Qd Jd\n3. Someone raised to 128\n4. I need to call 64 more\n5. I only have legal actions: fold, call\n\nGiven that I have Qd Jd and I'm extremely short-stacked, I should definitely go all-in here. It's a strong hand for a short stack, and I need to accumulate chips or go home.\n\nBut the format requires me to choose from fold, call, or raise. Since raise isn't listed as a legal action, but I need to put in all my chips, I think \"call\" is the appropriate action here (calling for my remaining stack).\n\nActually, let me reconsider: if the amount to call is 64 and I only have 11, I cannot call 64. In poker rules, I would be all-in for 11. The system should allow this as a \"call\" action that puts me all-in.\n\nSo my decision is: call (all-in for my remaining 11 chips).\n\nReasoning: With Qd Jd and only 0.2 BB left, this is a premium spot to get my money in. QJ suited has good equity against most ranges, and I need to win pots to survive in the tournament.\n\nLet me format this as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With Qd Jd and an extremely short stack of 0.2 BB, this is a premium spot to get all-in. QJ suited has strong equity against typical raising ranges, and I need to accumulate chips to survive in the tournament.\"\n}\n\nWait, but the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise option. But if I only have 11 chips and need to call 64, my only realistic option is to go all-in for 11, which should be treated as a call that puts me all-in.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The \"Amount to call: 64\" might be a display error, or it might mean I need to put in 64 more chips total (but I only have 11). In reality, if I only have 11 chips, I can go all-in for 11.\n\nBut the system says my legal actions are \"fold, call\" - not \"raise\". So I cannot explicitly raise or go all-in. I must either fold or call.\n\nIf I call, I would be calling for my remaining 11 chips (all-in). This seems to be the intended interpretation.\n\nSo my final decision is: call (all-in for 11 chips).\n\nReasoning: Qd Jd is a strong hand when short-stacked, especially from the BB. With only 0.2 BB left, I need to take any decent spot to get my money in, and QJ suited is definitely strong enough to call/shove here. The pot is already 224 chips, so winning this pot would significantly improve my tournament situation.\n\nLet me format this correctly as JSON:\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Qd Jd is a premium hand with an extremely short stack of 0.2 BB. I need to accumulate chips to survive, and QJ suited has strong equity",

With only 5.2 BB, better to preserve stack for a stronger hand. Pot odds (30% equity needed) are decent but postflop playability poor.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: Ks 5c (off-suit King-5)\n- Position: SB (small blind)\n- My stack: 336 chips (5.2 BB)\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Action: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 128 total (64 more than BB)\n- Amount to call: 96 chips\n- BB (Seat 1) has only 11 chips left\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** K5o is a weak hand, especially from the SB. King-5 offsuit has poor playability postflop.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the worst position (SB) and will be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** \n   - I have 336 chips (5.2 BB)\n   - Seat 2 (raiser) has 364 chips\n   - Seat 1 (BB) has only 11 chips and will likely fold or go all-in\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raises frequently preflop. Looking at their raises: 128, 318, 270, 222, 222, 222, 378, 96, 250, 234. They seem to be an aggressive player. Their showdown hands include K2, 88, Q7 - so they're raising with a wide range.\n\n5. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 224, I need to call 96. That's 2.33:1 pot odds (30% equity needed). K5o vs a typical raising range has about 35-40% equity, but being out of position reduces that.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** With only 5.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. However, I have position on the BB who has only 11 chips and will likely fold. This creates a heads-up situation against the raiser.\n\n7. **Alternative Options:** \n   - Fold: Preserve my stack for a better spot\n   - Call: See a flop with marginal odds, but out of position\n   - Raise: With K5o, raising seems too aggressive\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. K5o from the SB is too weak to call a raise, especially when I'll be out of position. The pot odds are decent (30% equity needed), but postflop play will be difficult with this hand. With only 5.2 BB, I should wait for a better spot to get my chips in.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any ICM pressure or bubble situation... The BB has only 11 chips, so they're essentially all-in blind next hand. This might create some fold equity if I raise, but with K5o, that's too speculative.\n\nActually, wait - the BB has 11 chips. If I call 96, the pot becomes 320. The BB only has 11 chips, so they can only call 11 more. This creates a side pot situation. But still, K5o is too weak.\n\nI'll fold and preserve my stack for a better spot.",

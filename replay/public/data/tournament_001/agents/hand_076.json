            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Th 6c (Ten of hearts, six of clubs) - This is a very weak hand, unsuited, not connected, and my ten is not strong enough to call raises with.\n\n**Position**: BB (Big Blind) - Not great, but I'm already invested with 16 chips.\n\n**Stack**: 473 chips (29.6 BB) - Healthy stack, tournament situation.\n\n**Current action**:\n- SB posted 8\n- BB (me) posted 16\n- Seat 2 raised to 48\n- Seat 3 re-raised to 122\n\n**Pot**: 186 chips\n**Amount to call**: 106 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 196 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis from recent actions**:\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- Has been raising preflop frequently (hands 72, 73, 75, 76)\n- In hand 72, raised 154 with KK (showdown)\n- In hand 73, raised 40 and bet flop\n- Seems like an aggressive player who raises with strong hands\n- Has 316 chips (19.75 BB)\n\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2):\n- Usually folds preflop (hands 69, 70, 71, 73, 75)\n- In hand 72, called 138 preflop with AQ (showdown)\n- In hand 74, raised 122 preflop (this is the same raise size as current hand!)\n- Has only 8 chips left (0.5 BB) - this is a short stack\n\n**Key insight**: Seat 3 is extremely short stacked with only 8 chips (0.5 BB). They're making a raise to 122 which is putting them all-in or almost all-in. This suggests they have a strong hand and are trying to get value before they get blinded out.\n\n**Hand evaluation**: Th 6c is a trash hand. I should be folding this 100% of the time in a normal situation.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 106 to win 186 \u2192 106/(186+106) = 106/292 = 36.3% equity needed.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack (29.6 BB)\n- Seat 3 is desperate with 0.5 BB\n- Seat 2 is aggressive and likely has a strong hand\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. I have a terrible hand, I'm facing aggression from two players, one of whom is desperate and likely has a strong hand. Even if I had pot odds, T6o is never going to have enough equity against two players' ranges. \n\nThis is especially true given that Seat 3 is short-stacked and making a big raise (relative to their stack), which typically indicates strength. I should preserve my tournament chips and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T6o is a very weak hand with no connectivity or suitedness.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with a JSON object. Let me think about this hand first. I'm in the small blind with Kc Ts, stack is 122 chips (7.6 BB). The pot is 72 chips. Seat 2 raised to 48 total, so I need to call 40 more chips. Minimum raise would be to 80 total.\n\nFirst, I should consider my position and hand strength. KTs is a decent hand, but not premium. I'm in the small blind, which is a bad position postflop. My stack is short at 7.6 BB, so I'm in push/fold territory.\n\nI need to understand Seat 2's raising tendencies. But the system is not letting me use tools without proper JSON response. Let me just make a decision based on basic poker principles.\n\nWith 7.6 BB, KTs is definitely in my shoving range from the small blind. However, there's already a raise from Seat 2. Seat 2 raised to 48 (3x BB). I have 122 chips total, so if I call 40, I'll have 82 left (5.1 BB) in a pot of 112. That's committing a lot of my stack.\n\nAlternatively, I could shove all-in for 122 total. That would be a raise to 122, which is legal since minimum raise is 80. \n\nPot odds: I need to call 40 to win 112 (72 pot + 40 my call). That's about 36% equity needed. KTs vs a typical raising range probably has around 35-45% equity depending on how tight Seat 2 is.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm in push/fold territory, and KTs plays well multi-way but I'm out of position... Actually, with the big blind still to act behind me (Seat 1), that's a concern. If I call, BB might squeeze.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think the best play is to either shove or fold. Calling leaves me with an awkward stack. KTs is strong enough to shove against a single raiser with my stack size.\n\nLet me check if I can recall any information about Seat 2... Oh wait, I need to respond with JSON. Let me just make a decision. I'll go all-in. KTs has good equity against many hands, and with my stack size, it's time to take a stand. If I fold, I'll be down to 114 chips (7.1 BB) next hand.\n\nI'll shove all-in.",

My stack is only 8 chips (0.5 BB), which is confusing because earlier it says my stack is 8 chips but blinds are 8/16. Actually wait, I posted SB of 8 chips preflop, and then raised to 122? That seems impossible with only 8 chips stack. Let me re-read.\n\nHand says: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but then preflop actions show: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" (that's me), \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 16\", \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 48\", \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 122\", \"preflop: Seat 1 fold\", \"preflop: Seat 2 call 74\".\n\nIf I only have 8 chips, how can I raise to 122? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the stack display is wrong or there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the pot size: 260 chips. Let's calculate: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 + my raise 122 + call 74? Actually need to calculate properly.\n\nSeat 1 (BB) posted 16, Seat 2 raised to 48 total (so added 32 more), then I raised to 122 total (so added 114 more from my SB of 8? Actually I posted SB 8, then raised to 122 means I put in 114 more). Then Seat 1 folded BB, Seat 2 called 74 more (to match 122). So pot should be: SB 8 + BB 16 + Seat 2's initial 48 + my raise to 122 (but I only had 8? hmm) + Seat 2's call 74 = 268? Actually let's compute: BB 16 + Seat 2's raise 48 = 64. Then my raise to 122 adds 122-8 (since I already posted 8) = 114. So pot now 64+114=178. Then Seat 2 calls 74 more (122-48=74). Total pot 178+74=252. But displayed pot is 260. Close but off by 8.\n\nAnyway, the key point: I have only 8 chips left? But I already put in 122? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is my current stack after posting SB and raising? Actually if I had 130 chips total, posted SB 8, then raised to 122 total, that would leave me with 130-122=8 chips. That makes sense! So I started with 130 chips, posted SB 8, then raised to 122 total (putting in 114 more), leaving me with 8 chips behind. Yes, that's it.\n\nSo now on the flop, I have 8 chips left, board is 9h 8d 5c, my hand is Kc Ts. I have a gutshot straight draw: need a J for a straight (T-J? Actually K T on board 9 8 5, I need a J for a straight: J would give me J T 9 8 7? Wait, I have K T, board 9 8 5. A J gives me J T 9 8 K - that's not a straight. Actually I need a Q for a straight: Q J T 9 8? That's not consecutive. Let's check: With K T, board 9 8 5, possible straights: I need J Q for a straight? K Q J T 9? That's king-high straight. Actually yes, if a Q and J come, I have K Q J T 9. But that's two cards. Or if a 7 comes, I have T 9 8 7 5? That's not a straight. Actually T 9 8 7 6 would be straight, but I have K T. So I have a gutshot to a straight if a J comes? Wait: J would give me J T 9 8 5 - that's not a straight. I need a J and a Q for a straight. So I have no straight draw. I have two overcards: K and T vs board 9 8 5. So I have two overcards, but the board is low and connected. My hand is not great.\n\nI'm heads-up against Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) who has 242 chips.

The hand says \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but blinds are 8/16. Actually, looking at preflop actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16, Seat 2 raise 48, Seat 3 raise 122, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 call 74. That means I raised to 122 total? But my stack is only 8 chips? Something doesn't add up.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but I posted SB of 8 chips. If I only have 8 chips total, I would be all-in with my SB. But the preflop action shows I raised to 122. That suggests my stack might be larger than 8 chips, or there's a mistake.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 334 chips. Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 8 + BB 16 + Seat 2 raise 48 + my raise to 122 + Seat 2 call 74. That's 8+16+48+122+74 = 268. But pot is 334, so there's 66 more somewhere. Maybe there were antes or something.\n\nBut more importantly: I have only 8 chips left? That would mean I'm effectively all-in preflop. But the flop action shows I checked and Seat 2 bet 74. If I only have 8 chips, I can't have any more to bet. The amount to call is 74, but I only have 8 chips total.\n\nWait, maybe \"Your Stack: 8 chips\" is incorrect or it means I have 8 chips remaining after the preflop action? Let me think: If I started with more chips, raised to 122, and now have 8 left, that means I started with 130 chips. That makes sense: 130 total, put in 122 preflop, leaving 8 behind. Yes! That must be it. So I have 8 chips left, and the bet is 74 to call. I can only call my remaining 8 chips.\n\nBut the legal actions are \"fold, call\" - no raise option. So I can either fold or call 74, but since I only have 8 chips, I can only call 8 chips (all-in). Actually, in poker, if a player doesn't have enough to call a full bet, they can go all-in for their remaining chips. So calling would put in my last 8 chips.\n\nLet me check the board: 9h 8d 5c. My hand: Kc Ts. I have King-high with a gutshot straight draw? Actually, T-9-8-7... I need a 7 or J for a straight. I have a gutshot to a J (J gives me J-T-9-8-7? Wait, board is 9-8-5, I have K-T. A J gives me J-T-9-8-5, which is a straight? Actually J-T-9-8-5 is not a straight; need 7 for a straight. Let me think: For a straight, I need Q-J or 7-6. Actually, with T and board 9-8-5, I need a 7 to make T-9-8-7-5 straight, or a J to make J-T-9-8-5? That's not a straight. Actually J-T-9-8-5 is J high, not a straight. So I have no straight draw. I have overcards (K high) and a backdoor flush draw? Kc and board has no clubs yet. Actually 5c is a club, so I have Kc and board has 5c, giving me a backdoor club flush draw. But not much.\n\nMy hand is weak. I'm basically drawing to a King or Ten. But I only have 8 chips left, and the pot is 334 chips. If I call 8 chips (all-in), I'm getting huge pot odds: 334:8 = about 41:1. Even with a weak hand, those odds are hard to pass up. I need only about 2.4% equity to break even. Even King-high probably has at least 10-15% equity against a range.\n\nBut I should consider opponent's range. Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 168 chips. They raised preflop to 48, called my 3-bet to 122. What range would call a 3-bet? Probably"

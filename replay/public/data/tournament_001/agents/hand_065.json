Looking at their history:\n- They fold preflop quite often (hands 53,54,57,58,60,61,62)\n- They sometimes check preflop (55,59,63,64)\n- When they do raise preflop (hand 56), they made it 60 and then bet aggressively on flop\n- Overall seems like a somewhat tight/passive player\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 6c 5h is terrible. Not suited, not connected, low cards. This is a fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, the worst position. I'll be first to act postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 21.6 BB, which is a decent stack. I don't need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 40 to win 72, which is about 1.8:1. That's not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n5. **Opponent tendency**: DeepSeek seems to raise with decent hands. Their preflop raise to 48 suggests strength.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. There's no need to gamble with 65o from the worst position. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, my position is bad, and I have no need to take this risk.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted SB 8, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted BB 16. No other players in the hand (Seats 4 and 5 folded).\n\nI need to decide preflop action. Amount to call is 16, minimum raise to 32.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (hands 60, 61, 62 folded). Called once in hand 63 and checked through. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, BB): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 in hand 60 preflop), but also calls and folds. Called a 47 chip bet in hand 62 preflop.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, especially in position on the button. With only the blinds left to act, this is a good spot to raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 19.2 BB, which is short but not critically short. The blinds have similar stacks (21.5 BB and 19.1 BB).\n\nTournament considerations: Need to accumulate chips. Pocket Tens is a premium hand in this situation.\n\nOptions:\n1. Call (16 chips): Not great - gives the blinds a cheap look at the flop with marginal hands.\n2. Raise: Standard play. I should raise to around 2.5-3x BB, which would be 40-48 chips.\n3. All-in: Too aggressive with pocket Tens when I have 19.2 BB.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, a raise is correct. I'll raise to 48 chips (3x BB).\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider from the opponents. The BB (Kimi-K2) raised preflop in hand 60, so might be willing to defend. But pocket Tens should do well against their ranges.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation with pocket tens (Th Td) from the button position. I have 308 chips (19.2 BB). The blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted the small blind of 8, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted the big blind of 16. I'm first to act preflop with only the blinds posted.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (folded hands 60, 61, 62), called once in hand 63, and checked from SB in hand 64. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression with a preflop raise in hand 60 to 24 (1.5x BB raise). They've called a few times and folded others.\n\nPocket tens is a strong hand, especially from the button. With only the blinds to act after me, I have position advantage. Standard play here would be to raise. The minimum raise is to 32 (double the big blind), but I should consider a larger raise.\n\nMy stack is 19.2 BB, which is getting short. In tournament play with this stack size, pocket tens is a premium hand that I want to get value from. I should raise to build the pot and potentially take it down preflop, or play a heads-up pot in position.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been folding a lot recently (hands 60-63 folded, hand 64 lost with weak hand). I need to accumulate chips. Pocket tens gives me a great opportunity.\n\nConsidering stack sizes: If I raise to around 48-64 (3-4x BB), that would be reasonable. But with my stack being 19.2 BB, I might consider a larger raise or even shove. However, shoving 19.2 BB with TT might be too aggressive when I can raise smaller and still have fold equity.\n\nThe blinds have 345 and 306 chips respectively (21.6 BB and 19.1 BB), so similar stacks. If I raise and get called, I'll have position postflop.\n\nI think raising to 48 (3x BB) is good. It builds the pot, gives me fold equity, and allows me to play postflop in position if called. If I get re-raised, I'd likely need to consider going all-in given my stack size.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should be aware of. Seat 2 raised preflop in hand 60 to 24 (1.5x BB), which is a small raise. So they might defend with a wide range.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I'm on the button with pocket tens. This is one of the best situations in poker. I should definitely raise. The question is how much.\n\nWith 19.2 BB, a standard raise of 2.5-3x BB would be 40-48 chips. That leaves me with 260-268 chips behind (16.3-16.8 BB), which is still playable.\n\nI'll raise to 48 (3x BB). This is aggressive enough to get respect but not commit me too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket tens is a premium hand from button position.

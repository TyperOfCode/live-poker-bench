Queen is decent but the 2 is terrible, and they're not suited (wait, they ARE suited - both clubs). So I have Q2 suited. Still a marginal hand at best.\n\n**Position:** BB - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 353 chips (88.2 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation:** \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 8 from Seat 3 (MP position)\n- Everyone else folded\n- I need to call 4 to see the flop\n\n**Opponent info (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32 (7 out of 10 hands)\n- Raised in hand 28 and was aggressive postflop (raised flop, bet turn)\n- No showdown data\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is a tight player who only raises with strong hands. Their raise to 8 (2x BB) is a min-raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** \nPot is 14 chips, I need to call 4. So 14:4 or 3.5:1 odds.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nQ2 suited is a weak hand, but suited. However, even with suitedness, this is a fold in most situations because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. Against a tight raiser who likely has a strong range\n3. Q2 has very poor equity against typical raising ranges\n4. Even if I hit a flush, I could be dominated by higher clubs\n\nThe pot odds are decent (3.5:1), but my hand equity is likely much worse than that against a tight raiser's range. \n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is an easy fold despite the suitedness and decent pot odds. The hand is just too weak and I'm out of position against a tight player.",

From history, seems fairly tight - folded preflop last 2 hands, but showed KK in hand #9.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 119 chips (29.75 BB), in SB position. Very tight - folded preflop in 9 of last 10 hands, only called once.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 98o is a speculative hand. Not premium, but has potential to make straights and decent pairs. Being on the button is huge advantage.\n2. **Position**: Button is the best position - can see how others act before deciding.\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 66.5 BB, comfortable. Seat 5 has only 29.75 BB, might be short-stack cautious.\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Both seem tight. Seat 1 (BB) has been folding recently. Seat 5 (SB) is extremely tight.\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 4 to win 6 gives 1.5:1 odds. With implied odds if I hit a good flop, could be profitable.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack, can afford to play speculative hands in position.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Conservative play with marginal hand.\n- **Call**: Take favorable position with decent pot odds.\n- **Raise**: Could try to steal blinds given tight opponents.\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents (especially Seat 5 who folds almost always preflop), and my excellent position, I think a small raise could be profitable. If I raise, Seat 5 (SB) will likely fold given their tight tendencies, and Seat 1 (BB) might fold too based on recent folding pattern.\n\nHowever, 98o is not a great hand to raise with from button against only blinds. But with such tight opponents, it might work. Alternatively, I could just call and see a flop cheaply.\n\nActually, let me check: Minimum raise to is 8 chips total (4 more). That's not much - just doubling the BB. If I raise to 8 total (4 more), I'm risking 4 more chips for potential to win 6 chips now.\n\nGiven Seat 5's extreme tightness (folded 9 of last 10 preflop), I think a small raise has good chance of success.

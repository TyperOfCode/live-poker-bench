Even against two random hands, Q2o only has about 35% equity, but against actual raising ranges it's much worse (likely 20-25% at best).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** I have no data on these specific opponents yet since the search returned no results.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- It's early in the tournament (Hand #4)\n- I have a healthy stack\n- There's already significant aggression (3-bet to 12)\n- I'm out of position\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Q2o is a trash hand, I'm out of position, facing a 3-bet, and the implied odds are terrible. Even if I hit a Q, I'll often be dominated, and if I hit a 2, I'll rarely get paid off. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand, and I don't want to get involved in a bloated pot out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision with A5s from UTG. I have 231 chips (115.5 BB). The blinds are 1/2, so I'm deep stacked. My hand is A\u26605\u2660 - suited ace with a weak kicker.\n\nFrom UTG (under the gun), this is an early position. A5s is generally considered a weak hand from UTG in tournament poker. With 5 players left to act behind me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB), I face significant risk of being raised or playing a multi-way pot with a dominated hand.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the limited data: they've mostly folded or called in previous hands. No aggressive raises observed yet. However, I have no reads on how they react to UTG opens.\n\nStack sizes: I'm the chip leader with 231, others have 180-197 chips. This gives me some leverage but also means I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal hands.\n\nTournament considerations: We're deep stacked (115BB), so I can afford to be patient. A5s has some playability postflop due to suitedness, but from UTG it's problematic. The best case is to flop a flush draw or two pair, but I'm often dominated by better aces.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 2 chips into pot of 3 (1.5:1 odds). But if I raise, I'd be putting in more chips with a weak hand.\n\nStandard play here would be to fold A5s from UTG, especially with deep stacks. I could consider a raise to 6-8BB to try to take it down preflop, but that's risky with 5 players behind who might call or re-raise.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, the prudent play is to fold. I should wait for better spots, especially since I'm chip leader and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of opponents folding to raises... Looking at hand #3, everyone folded to my BTN raise with 84s. But that was from button, not UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold A5s from UTG. It's too weak for early position, especially with deep stacks.",

This is a marginal hand from early position. A5 suited is not typically a raising hand from UTG - it's usually a fold or sometimes a limp. The problem is I'm first to act after the blinds, so I'm in the worst position at the table.\n\nLet me consider tournament strategy. With 115 BB, I have a deep stack. A5 suited has some potential with flush possibilities and ace-high, but it's a weak ace. From UTG, I should be playing tight.\n\nThe players behind me: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). I don't have information about them yet, but being in early position with a weak hand suggests folding.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with A5 suited, I think the correct play is to fold. This hand has reverse implied odds - if I hit an ace, I could be dominated by better aces. The suited aspect gives some flush potential, but not enough to justify playing from early position.\n\nI should wait for better spots with my deep stack. Let me fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand strength**: I have Js As, and the board shows Jh Jd 4c, giving me three Jacks (trips) with an Ace kicker. This is an extremely strong hand - top set on a paired board.\n\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B has folded in all 3 previous hands I've seen. This suggests they might be playing tight/passive.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in the button position, which gives me positional advantage.\n\n4. **Stack situation**: I have 177 chips (88.5 BB), which is a decent stack. The opponent has 178 chips, so we're relatively even in stack size.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 42 chips, and I'm facing no bet (opponent checked). I can check and see the turn, or I can bet to build the pot.\n\n6. **Board texture**: The board shows Jh Jd 4c - this is a paired board which makes me very strong. The only hand that beats me would be pocket Aces (which would give quads), pocket Jacks (which would also be quads), or a very unlikely straight (which isn't really possible here).\n\nGiven that:\n- I have an extremely strong hand (top set)\n- The opponent has been passive (folded in previous hands)\n- I'm in position\n- There's no bet to call\n\nThis seems like a good spot to bet for value. I should make a bet that:\n1. Gets value from worse hands (like top pair, middle pair, etc.)\n2. Builds the pot for when I'm likely ahead\n3. Doesn't scare away too many opponents\n\nA bet of around 15-20 chips (about 35-50% of the pot) would be appropriate. This sizes the bet to get value while not being too aggressive.\n\nI'll raise to 18 chips, which is about 43% of the pot - a good value bet sizing.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on flop. Situation: BB (seat5) with Qs Ks, board Jh Jd 4c. Preflop we were in BB, posted 1, then raise 12 after opponent raise to 4? Actually actions: Seat4 raise 4 (UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2). Then Seat5 raise 12 (re-raise). Seat1 folds. Seat4 raise 20 (3-bet). Seat5 call 8 (call to 20). So pot 42 includes blinds etc. Now flop: Jh Jd 4c. So we have QsKs, no pair, no draw. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised preflop, likely a strong range (maybe broadway, pairs). On flop, opponent likely continuation bet? But amount to call is 0, meaning opponent checked? Wait actions: amount to call 0, so we have option to check or raise. So opponent (MiniMax) must have checked. So board: double Jacks, 4c. Our hand QK, overcards. No flush draw (two clubs on board? Actually 4c is club, we have Qs Ks, both spades and hearts? Qs, Ks, both spades? Actually Qs is spade, Ks spade. So no club. So no flush draw. Straight draw? J-4, we have K Q, could make straight if 10 and 9? Actually need 10 and 9 for straight with J J 4? Not possible. So just overcards.\n\nWe need to decide check or raise. Consider opponent's range: preflop they raised to 4 (open), then 3-bet to 20 after our re-raise. They are likely strong: maybe AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe suited connectors. On flop double Jacks, they likely have Jacks, maybe overpair (AA, KK, QQ), or AK/AQ etc. They checked, maybe they missed, or they have a hand like AK that wants to see turn. We have QK, which is overcards, but no pair. If we bet, we could represent a jack? But we have no jack. Could we bluff? Could be effective if opponent folds weaker hands like AQ? Actually AQ would have Q, but they'd have top pair with queen kicker? Wait board J J 4, AQ has queen, not a pair. So they'd have overcards. So they'd likely fold to a bet if they have weak overcards. But also they might have Jacks, they'd call. So risk.\n\nWe have a fairly deep stack (89 BB). Pot 42. A raise could be maybe 2-3x pot? That would be about 84-126 chips. That might pressure. But if they have Jacks they'd call. If they have overpair they'd maybe call as well. So we risk losing many chips. Maybe better to check and see turn.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB but flop is after opponent checked, we are first to act? Actually we are BB, opponent is seat4 (UTG?) They are left of us? The action order is from left of button? In flop, the first active player to the left of the button acts first. The button is seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB? Wait seat1 is SB? Actually preflop: Seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat4 is UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, they opened raise preflop. So flop action order: seat4 (UTG) is first, then seat5 (SB). Since seat4 checked, seat5 acts next. So we are out of position (first to act after opponent). So raising is a bluff, but we are out of position, which is less effective.\n\nThus best to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\nReasoning: we have no pair, only overcards, opponent likely strong, check to preserve.\n\n",

No pair, no straight draws (board pairs Jacks, low cards). Our hand is weak. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 is the only remaining opponent. He bet 18 on flop, we called. Pot after flop: preflop pot 2 (bb) + raise 4+12+20+8? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 4 (seat4), raise to 12 (seat5), raise to 20 (seat4), call 8 (seat5). So after preflop, pot: SB 1+BB 2+4+12+20+8 = 47? Actually need to sum contributions: seat4 put 4 then 20 (total 24). seat5 put 1 (sb) +12 +8 =21. seat1 put 2 (bb). So pot = 2+1+24+21 =48? Wait double-check: SB is seat5 posted 1, BB seat1 posted 2. Then seat4 raise to 4 (so adds 2 more beyond 2? Actually big blind is 2, seat4 raise to 4 means he puts 4 total, so net contribution 4). Then seat5 raise to 12 (adds 11 more beyond 1). Then seat1 folds. Then seat4 raise to 20 (adds 16 more). Then seat5 call 8 (adds 8 more). So total contributions: seat4: 4+16 =20? Wait raise to 20 means total 20, not add 16? He already had 4 in, so adds 16. So seat4 total =20. seat5 total = 1+11+8 =20. seat1 =2. So pot =20+20+2 =42. But the given pot before flop is 78 after flop betting? Actually after flop, pot is 78 chips. Flop: seat5 check (no bet), seat4 bet 18, seat5 call 18. So pot adds 36 to previous 42 =78. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2s. Pot 78, we have Qs Ks. Opponent's range likely includes strong Jacks (set), two pair, maybe overpairs like AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe draws? He bet 18 on flop, we called, so he might have a made hand or a draw. Turn card is 2s, which likely doesn't help many draws except maybe a gutshot? Not relevant.\n\nOur hand is likely losing. We could check or fold. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we check and hope river? Likely we should just check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising is not good.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have a turn scenario. Our hand: Qs Ks. Board: Jh Jd 4c 2s. So we have QK with no pair, we have a gutshot? Actually board has J J 4 2. We have overcards, but also possible straight draws? Board: J J 4 2. Our hand Q K. Potential: we have a backdoor straight draw? Not really. We have two overcards, could make top pair if a Jack hits, but we already have two Jacks on board, so any Jack would give opponent a set if they have J. But we have no pair. Our hand currently is just high cards, no pair, no draw. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 18 on turn after we checked. Pot currently 96+18+18 (flop bet and call) = 132? Let's compute: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, then raise to 4 (MiniMax) then raise to 12 (us) then raise to 20 (MiniMax) then call 8 (us) = contributions: seat4: 4 + 20 = 24? Actually seat4 raise 4 (initial) then later raise to 20 (i.e., added 16 more) total 20? Wait: preflop: seat4 raise 4 (so puts 4). seat5 raise 12 (so puts 12). seat1 fold. seat4 raise 20 (so total 20). seat5 call 8 (so puts additional 8 to match 20). So contributions: seat4: 20, seat5: 12+8=20. plus blinds: seat5 posted small blind 1, seat1 posted big blind 2. So total pot after preflop: 20+20+1+2 = 43? But also seat5 posted SB 1 earlier, but then raised 12 (including the 1? Usually raise to 12 means total 12, so additional 11). But we can approximate pot after preflop maybe 43. Flop: seat5 check (0), seat4 bet 18, seat5 call 18. So pot adds 36, total pot 79. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 18. So pot before turn bet: 79. After bet 18, pot becomes 97. The amount to call is 18, making total pot after call 115. So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely opponent has something like a set (J), two pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a made hand. We have no showdown value. Should we fold? Probably yes. But we need to consider stack depth: we have 160 chips, opponent 141. Bet 18 is about 11% of our stack. Could we bluff? Probably not with QK, not strong enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall turn actions of MiniMax-M2. The tool returned none (no data). So we have no info. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

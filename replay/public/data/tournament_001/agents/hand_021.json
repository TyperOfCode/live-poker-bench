            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9c 5c - This is a weak, non-connected, low suited hand. Very marginal even in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button) - Best position at the table.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - Small blind posted 2\n   - Big blind posted 4\n   - Player in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Very tight player - folds most hands preflop\n   - Has only raised preflop once before (hand #12) to 8 chips\n   - Called 4 chips in hand #13 but folded on the flop\n   - Called 1 chip in hand #19 and bet 2 on flop\n   - Overall pattern: selective, plays few hands, seems to bet small amounts\n\n   So this raise to 8 from a normally tight player suggests they have a real hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 14 before their raise\n   - They raise to 8 (which is a min-raise)\n   - Pot becomes 22\n   - I need to call 8\n   - Pot odds: 22:8 or 2.75:1\n   - Required equity: ~27%\n\n7. **Hand evaluation**: 9c 5c has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, this hand performs poorly. It's not connected, low cards, only the suited aspect gives it any playability.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling with such a weak hand out of position (though I'm on the button) against a tight player's raise is -EV. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. My hand is too weak, the opponent is tight and showing strength, and I don't have the right pot odds to chase with this speculative hand. Even with position, the hand has very limited potential.",

It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB (small blind), which is the worst position at the table. I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Action so far**: \n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 (2x BB)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) 3-bet to 24 (6x BB)\n\n4. **Stack sizes**:\n   - My stack: 252 chips (63 BB)\n   - Seat 2: 157 chips (39 BB) \n   - Seat 5: 139 chips (35 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 36 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8 + 3-bet 24 - my BB 4 already in). I need to call 20 to win 56 (36 + 20). That's about 2.8:1 pot odds, or ~26% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: 6-3o has maybe 20-25% equity against a typical 3-betting range. But we're in terrible position with a hand that plays poorly postflop. Even if we hit a pair, we're often dominated.\n\n7. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has mostly folded preflop, but raised twice in recent hands (hands 16 and 17). This 3-bet is aggressive.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has mostly folded preflop, but called once and bet once postflop.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (63 BB). No need to gamble with trash hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n9. **Additional factors**: Seat 5 still has to act after me. If I call, they might 4-bet or call, creating a multiway pot with a terrible hand out of position.\n\nThe math doesn't justify calling. Even with decent pot odds, 6-3o is just too weak. We'll be playing a big pot out of position with a hand that rarely improves to anything strong.

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #21 preflop. Position BB, Ad9h (Ace of diamonds, 9 hearts). Stack 139 chips (~34.8 BB). Blinds 2/4, so big blind 4.\n\nAction: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) posted small blind 2, Seat3 posted big blind 4 (but seat3 is folded? Actually seat3 posted BB 4, then later seat3 fold). Seat4 folded. Seat5 (us) raise to 8 (so we opened 4 over BB? Actually we are BB, we raise to 8 (i.e., 4 more). Then seat1 fold. Seat2 raise to 24 (so they re-raise to 24). Seat3 fold.\n\nNow we face a raise to 24, we have already put 8, so amount to call 16 (to match 24). Minimum raise to 40 (so raise total to 40). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand Ad9h offsuit. In BB vs SB re-raise. SB is Kimi-K2. We have some data: Kimi-K2's raise amounts: 18 (hand1), 6,6,6. So they have raised small amounts often (6) maybe wide range. But they also raised 18 once. Not a lot of data. Our hand is Ace-9 offsuit, decent but not premium. In BB vs SB 3-bet, typical ranges: SB's 3-bet range maybe wide, but with 34 BB we can consider call or fold. Stack depth moderate. 24 is 6 BB (since big blind 4, 24/4=6 BB). That's a sizable 3-bet.\n\nOur hand Ad9 offsuit is about 8%? Actually A9 offsuit is around 12% vs random. In BB vs SB 3-bet, it's marginal. Usually you would fold A9o unless you have good implied odds or you think opponent is loose. Our stack is 34 BB, not huge but enough.\n\nWe also have pot 36 (blinds+our raise). If we call 16, pot will be 36+16+16? Actually after SB raises to 24, pot = 36 (original) + 24 (SB) + 8 (our raise) = 68? Wait timeline: Preflop: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, pot = 6. We raise to 8 (total), so we put 4 extra (since we already have 4). So we add 4, pot = 10. SB folds? Actually seat1 fold, SB raise to 24, adding 22 more (since they already put 2). So pot becomes 10 + 22 = 32? Wait compute: Starting pot after blinds = 6. Our raise to 8: we add 4 (so total contributed by us = 8). Pot = 6 + 4 = 10. SB raise to 24: they add 22 (since already 2). Pot = 10 + 22 = 32. Then we need to call 16 to match 24 (we have 8 already). So if we call, we add 16, pot = 48. So calling gives us 48 pot for 16 call = 3:1 pot odds, 33% needed. Our hand equity vs unknown range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline.\n\nGiven limited data, maybe fold. Also we have 34 BB, preserving stack is important. I'd likely fold A9o to a 3-bet from SB.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

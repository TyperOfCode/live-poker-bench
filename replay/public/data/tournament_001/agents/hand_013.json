Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand (#13) - Preflop:**\n- My position: UTG (Seat 1)\n- My cards: 2s Jc (2 of spades, Jack of clubs)\n- My stack: 369 chips (184.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Players: 5 total\n- Action so far: Seat 4 posted SB (1), Seat 5 posted BB (2)\n- Amount to call: 2 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 4 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n2s Jc is a very weak hand:\n- Offsuit\n- Low kicker (2)\n- No connectivity\n- No suited potential\n- This is a trash hand that should be folded from any position, especially UTG\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position - I have to act first postflop and have no information about opponents' actions.\n\n**Opponent tendencies (from recall):**\nFrom the recalled data:\n- Hand #11: Only DeepSeek-V3.2 called preflop, then check-raised on flop\n- Hand #12: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 chips preflop, everyone else folded\n\nThis limited sample shows:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 can be aggressive postflop (check-raised flop)\n- GPT-OSS-120B can raise preflop\n- Most players are folding frequently\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm in decent shape with 184.5 BB\n- No need to risk chips with a trash hand\n- Preserving stack is important\n- There's no pressure to play marginal hands\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2 chips\n- Getting 1.5:1 odds\n- But this is irrelevant with such a weak hand - I shouldn't be calling anyway\n\n**Decision:**\n2s Jc from UTG is an auto-fold. This hand has:\n- No high card value (Jack with 2 kicker is terrible)\n- No suited value\n- No connectivity\n- No implied odds\n- Reverse implied odds (could make second-best hand)\n\nI should fold immediately and wait for a better spot.\n\nThe reasoning is clear: trash hand from worst position with no justification to play.",

Currently has a short stack of 46 chips.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding frequently (8/10 times), but raised in the last hand (hand #12) to 8 chips.

I'm facing the SB (1 chip) and BB (2 chips). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. The pot is 3 chips currently.\n\nFrom the button with A9o, this is a standard open-raise spot. The SB has a very short stack and might be forced to defend with a wide range. The BB has been folding a lot but just raised last hand, so might be getting more active.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, I should raise to take initiative. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so 5-6 chips total. Let me raise to 6 chips total (4 more chips on top of the 2 to call).\n\nThis puts pressure on the short-stacked SB and tests the BB who has been folding frequently. If either player calls, I have position advantage postflop with an Ace-high hand that could improve to top pair.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Standard button raise with A9o.

The board is low cards with no obvious draws (no flush draws, straight draws possible with 6-8 but not likely). \n\nLooking at opponent's history: they've been folding a lot preflop (7 of 10 actions), raised once preflop in hand #5 and once in hand #12. They called my preflop raise this hand. Their stack is 148 chips (74 BB), which is smaller than my 243 chips. \n\nI should consider betting for value with top pair. The pot is 13 chips. I could check behind to see a turn card, but betting seems better to get value from worse hands like lower pairs or draws. The minimum raise is 4, but I could bet around 8-10 chips (half to 3/4 pot). \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold often, they might fold to a continuation bet. But they called preflop, so they likely has some hand. I have position advantage being on the button.\n\nI think a moderate bet is good here. Let's say 9 chips (about 2/3 pot).

Let me analyze the key factors:\n\n**Hand Strength**: 7h 3h is one of the weakest possible starting hands. Even though it's suited, the gap between the cards and the low ranks make this hand have very little equity against typical opening ranges.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the worst position (small blind), which means I'll be out of position for the entire hand if I call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: With 23 BB, I need to be selective about which hands I play. This isn't a hand worth investing 5 chips in.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 5 chips into a 9-chip pot (1.8:1 odds), which isn't sufficient to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been active with preflop raises (6 and 45 chips in recent hands), suggesting they have a reasonable raising range. My 7h 3h is likely dominated by most hands they'd raise with.\n\n**Tournament Strategy**: At this stack size, I need to preserve chips for better opportunities. 7h 3h from the small blind is definitely a fold, especially when facing a raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"7h 3h is a very weak hand from the small blind, especially when facing a raise. Poor position, weak equity, and need for chip preservation at 23 BB stack size all justify folding this hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7h 3h - This is a very weak hand, especially from the small blind. Suited connectors in the 7-3 range have very little equity and are generally considered foldable in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is the worst position in poker. I have to act before the big blind, and I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand if I call.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 46 chips (23 BB), which is a medium stack. I'm not short-stacked yet, but I need to be careful with my chip preservation.\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised to 6 chips. Looking at their history, they've made raises of 45 and 6 chips in previous hands, suggesting they can raise with various hands.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind with 152 chips. They've been active with raises of 12, 4, and 8 chips in recent hands.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 9 chips, I need to call 5 more to see the flop. This gives me pot odds of 9:5 or 1.8:1, which isn't great for such a weak hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I'm at 23 BB, so I need to be selective about which hands I play. 7h 3h is definitely in the \"fold\" category, especially from the small blind.\n\n7. **Range considerations**: Both opponents have shown willingness to raise preflop, suggesting they have reasonable ranges. My 7h 3h is likely dominated by most of their raising ranges.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is very weak (7h 3h)\n- I'm out of position\n- I need to call 5 chips into a 9-chip pot (not great odds)\n- I'm at a stack size where I need to be selective\n\n\n- My previous small blind performance has been consistently poor\n\nI'll confidently choose to fold. The hand's weakness, combined with my track record in the small blind, makes this an easy decision. The potential risks far outweigh any marginal gains I might hope for with these cards.\n",

Might be okay to call and see flop. So choose call.\n\nReasoning: hand has decent equity, deep stack, opponent raise from early position may be wide, we can see flop cheap. Also preserving stack.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Actually we have 7d, board 7c gives pair of sevens, plus we have gutshot? We have 8d, board 9h 5s, no straight draw (needs 6 for 5-6-7-8-9, we have 8 and 7, need 6). We have a backdoor flush draw (two diamonds, need two more). Opponent seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG? seat3). We called with 7d8d (suited connector). Now flop 7c 9h 5s. Opponent's action? Not shown. We have amount to call 0, so opponent checked? Actually after flop, actions list not included. Since amount to call 0, it's our turn, we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot bet (raise is the only bet). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount. Minimum raise to 4 means total bet of 4 chips (since pot 13). So we can raise to 4 (i.e., bet 4). Need to consider opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG likely strong: maybe 66+, AQs+, etc. Could include 7x combos? 7-8 suited could be in range but less likely. On flop with 7c, they likely have top pair (9s) or overpairs (TT+, maybe 99? Actually board 7c 9h 5s, overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA would be ahead of our pair. They could also have 9x, 79, 78, 67, 56 draws. Our pair 7s is second pair. Might be behind many. But we have backdoor flush and gutshot. Pot is 13, we have 148 stack. Should we check to see opponent's action? If we bet, we might get called by better hands, losing value. Checking may give us free card, but also allow opponent to bet and we may be forced to call with marginal hand. Considering we are out of position (BB vs UTG), maybe check. But we have a decent hand (pair of 7s) but board is relatively dry. Could we check-raise? Not allowed because opponent hasn't bet. So we can either bet small to protect against draws? There are potential straight draws like 6-8, 6-7, 8-6, but not many. Might be okay to bet 4 (about 1/3 pot) to get value from worse hands (like 6-6, 5-6, 8-5, etc.) and protect. Opponent's range includes maybe 66, 55 (but 55 is set? Actually board has 5s, so 55 would be set, they'd bet). 66 would be overpair, they'd likely bet. So betting may get called by better, losing. Checking might induce opponent to bet with worse (like a draw) and we can call. But we risk giving free card.\n\nGiven tournament, we have a medium stack, but not short. I'd likely check and see what opponent does. So action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 7d8d, board 7c9h5s. We have middle pair (7s) with a gutshot straight draw (6) and backdoor flush draw (diamonds). Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG? seat3). He now bets 15 into pot 28 (pot after flop: 28? Actually preflop pot: blinds 1+2+6+2? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6 (so total 6+1+2? Actually raise to 6 means put 6 total, so extra 4 from UTG plus 1 from SB and 2 from BB? But anyway pot 28 given). He bets 15. We have 148 stack, effective stack ~ 148-? we have 148 total, we put 2 BB preflop, call 4, now 15 to call. So decision: call, raise, or fold.\n\nHand strength: Pair of sevens, top pair? Board: 7c 9h 5s. Opponent may have 9x, 7x, 5x, maybe straight draws like 6-8, 8-10, etc. Our 7d8d gives us pair and open-ended? Actually we have 7 and 8, board 7,9,5. So we have pair of sevens, plus we have 8 gives us gutshot to 6-10? Wait need 6 for straight: 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight, we have 7 and 8, board 5,9, need 6 to complete. So gutshot. Also we have backdoor flush draw (diamonds) but board has no diamond. So limited.\n\nOpponent bet 15, about half pot (pot 28). So pot odds: need 15 to win pot of 43 (28+15). So odds ~ 35% needed. Our equity vs random? Probably less. But we need to consider opponent's range: Preflop raise from UTG likely strong: maybe 77+, AJs+, KQs, etc. Could also be suited connectors. On flop 7c9h5s, he bets. He could have 9x, 7x, 5x, overpairs, AK, etc. Our hand is likely second best unless he missed. We have pair of sevens, but board also has 7, so we have top pair? Could be if opponent doesn't have a 7. But opponent could have 9, overpair, etc. So calling is risky.\n\nWe have stack 148, can we raise? Minimum raise to 30 (so raise to 30). That would be a raise of 15 more. Could be a semi-bluff? With gutshot and backdoor flush, but not great. Might fold.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have 74 BB, decent stack, but not huge. Likely best to fold to preserve stack.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

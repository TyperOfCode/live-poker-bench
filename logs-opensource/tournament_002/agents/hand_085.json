            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: 2d Qs (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 130 chips (4.1 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Action: Need to call 16 more to see flop\n\n**Opponent (MiniMax-M2):**\n- Seat 4, Big Blind with 686 chips (big stack)\n- Recent actions show they call/fold a lot preflop\n- They folded on flop in hands 77, 84 after calling preflop\n- They bet on flop in hand 82 after calling preflop\n- No showdowns seen\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q2 offsuit is a terrible hand. No suitedness, no connectivity, just one high card.\n\n2. **Stack situation**: I'm extremely short stacked at 4.1 BB. This is critical tournament survival territory. I need to be very selective.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but my hand is too weak.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (pot) = 25% pot odds. Even with my short stack, this is not a good spot.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 4.1 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling here would leave me with 114 chips (3.6 BB) and I'd be out of position post-flop. This is terrible for my tournament life.\n\n6. **Opponent tendency**: MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop often but folds to aggression post-flop. However, with Q2o I have very little equity even if I hit.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q2o is not a hand to risk tournament life with, even from the button. I should preserve my 4.1 BB for a better spot - ideally when I can shove preflop with some fold equity or with a much stronger hand. Calling here just bleeds chips and leaves me in bad shape.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm in the SB and already posted 16. The BB is 32. So I need to call 16 more to see the flop. But with 130 chips (4.1 BB), calling 16 chips is about 12% of my stack. That's significant.\n\nWith Q2o, I have very poor equity. Even on the button (which I'm not - I'm in SB), this is a fold. The fact that I'm short stacked makes it an even clearer fold. I need to wait for a better spot to get my chips in.",

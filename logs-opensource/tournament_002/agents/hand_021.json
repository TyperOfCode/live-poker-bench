Ten-high with a terrible kicker (2c).\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Good position, but doesn't make up for the terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 220 chips (55 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: It's folded to me on the button. SB and BB are the only players left.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 13, 14, 16, 18, 19). Called in hands 17 and 20. Raised once in hand 12. Seems relatively tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Very tight! Folded preflop in hands 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. That's 7 consecutive folds! Only played hand 13 where they reached showdown with Q3s. This player is extremely tight.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. I don't have that with T2o.\n\n**Decision**: Even though I'm on the button and the blinds seem tight (especially BB who folds 87.5% of the time based on recent data), T2o is just too weak to play. The SB could defend, and even if they both fold often, the times they don't I'll be in bad shape.\n\nI should fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot. It's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, no need to get involved with such a weak holding.\n\n**Action**: Fold",

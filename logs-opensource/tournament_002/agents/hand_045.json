            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6h 3c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. In any position, this is a fold preflop.\n\n2. **My position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is the worst position at the table (second to act preflop but first to act postflop).\n\n3. **My stack**: 178 chips (22.2 BB) - This is a decent stack size, but not so deep that I can afford to bleed chips.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Blinds: 4/8\n   - I've already posted 4 as SB\n   - BB posted 8\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 48\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - They've made several preflop raises: 8, 24, 16\n   - They seem to be an active player\n   - In hand 44, they raised to 16 then folded (possibly to a re-raise)\n   - They don't seem extremely tight or loose based on this limited sample\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 60 (4 + 8 + 48)\n   - I need to call 44 to see the flop\n   - Pot odds: 60:44 or ~1.36:1\n   - This is not great odds for a hand this weak\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have 22.2 BB which is a workable stack\n   - Calling here would commit 25% of my stack (44/178) with a terrible hand\n   - If I call and miss the flop (very likely with 6-3 offsuit), I'll be in a difficult position out of position\n   - This could easily become a -EV spot that bleeds my chips\n\n8. **Hand equity**: 6-3 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, I'm likely at best 30% equity, and probably much less against a typical raise.\n\nThe only argument for calling would be if I had a very specific read that GPT-OSS-120B is raising with complete garbage and I could outplay them postflop. But:\n- I don't have enough data to support this\n- Even if they are raising wide, 6-3 offsuit is still terrible\n- I'll be out of position which makes postflop play very difficult\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. With 6-3 offsuit in the SB facing a 6x BB raise, I should fold immediately. The hand is too weak, the position is bad, and the tournament cost is too high.\n\nI need to preserve my 22.2 BB stack for better spots. This is not a good spot to defend the blind or try to get creative.",

Q6o is definitely a fold from UTG. It's offsuit, weak kicker, and I'm in early position with many players left to act.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with 24.5 BB, I should be looking for better spots. Q6o is not a hand I want to play from UTG. Even if I call 8 chips (4% of my stack), I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to call into a pot of 20 (12 already + 8 from me), so I'd need about 28.6% equity. While Q6o might have some equity against random hands, it's not enough to justify playing from UTG, especially since I'll likely face raises behind me.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

Amount to call is 8 (BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise by 8 more). We have a premium hand, but stack is short (19 BB). Opponent seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) with 178 chips. We have data of past raises: seat1 raised amounts varying: 6,5,12,12,48. Those are amounts, not total? Probably raise amount? Not sure. The last raise was 48 (maybe total raise? Could be raise amount? Hard to interpret). In any case, they have been raising sometimes big. But we are on button with kings. We can consider raising to isolate and build pot. Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total 16). Our stack is 153, so we could raise bigger, maybe to 48 or more. However, we need to consider opponent's tendencies: they have raised 48 previously, which is a big raise (maybe they are aggressive). But we have a strong hand; we should raise to protect against being called by many players. Only SB and BB remain (two opponents). Both have decent stacks: 178 and 218. They may call or re-raise. We could raise to maybe 48 (like they did before) to isolate and get value. But we also have short stack relative to blinds? 19 BB is not extremely short; can still raise.\n\nWe need to ensure we are not overcommitting if they re-raise all-in.

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks Kh vs board T\u2660 2\u2660 2\u2665. We have top set of Kings. Opponent (BB) checked. Pot 100, we have 105 stack, we are short stacked (13 BB). We have a very strong hand, but we need to consider opponent's range and potential draws. Board is paired low, possible full house draws (e.g., 2x, T's). Opponent could have T2 combos, 2x, maybe a straight draw? No straight possible (board T 2 2). So only possible threats are full house (2s) or maybe a set of Tens (but they would have to have T2? Actually set of Tens requires TT, but board has T\u2660 only one ten, need another ten in hand, possible TT). Also could have a full house with T2 (e.g., T2 gives full house Tens over Twos? Actually board: T 2 2, hand T2 gives two pair (T and 2) not full house. Full house would be TT2 or 222T etc. So opponent could have a set of Twos (2x) giving full house Twos over Tens (2 2 2 T T?). Wait board has two twos, need third two for set, plus a ten for full house? Actually full house is three of a kind plus a pair. If opponent has 2x (third two) and also a ten, they'd have full house twos over tens (222 TT). That's possible only with hand 2T. Also could have TT (pair of tens) making set of tens (TT) with board T gives three tens, plus board has two twos, so they'd have full house tens over twos (TTT 22). So opponent could have TT, 2T, or maybe 2x with no ten (just set of twos) which would be just three of a kind twos, which loses to our set of kings. So we have best possible hand except opponent could have full house (TT or 2T). Those are combos: TT (3 combos) but one ten is on board, remaining tens: hearts, clubs, diamonds (3). 2T combos: need a two (there are two twos on board, remaining two: spades and clubs? Actually board has 2\u2660 and 2\u2665, so remaining twos: 2\u2666 and 2\u2663 = 2 combos) and a ten (remaining tens: hearts, clubs, diamonds = 3). So combos = 2*3 =6 combos. So total full house combos = 9 combos. Also opponent could have a straight draw? No.\n\nThus we have a strong hand, but opponent may have a full house. Should we bet? Yes, we should bet for value. But we have short stack; we can go all-in (105). Minimum raise is 40, raising to 105 is all-in. Pot is 100, we can raise to 105 (all-in) making pot 205 (if called). That's good value. Opponent may call with full house combos (9 combos) or maybe with a lower pair? But they might call with any pair? With short stack, they might call with any decent hand. But we have to consider that we are short stacked and need chips. So we should raise all-in.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We should raise all-in to 105. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

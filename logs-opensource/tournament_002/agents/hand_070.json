            "reasoning_content": "  This is a critical tournament situation. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Kh - This is a very weak hand, offsuit with a low kicker\n2. **My position**: SB - Worst position postflop\n3. **My stack**: 154 chips (9.6 BB) - Short stack, in danger zone\n4. **Action**: There's been a raise to 48, then a re-raise to 100, then another re-raise to 211\n5. **Amount to call**: 203 chips - This would commit almost my entire stack (leaving me with just 51 chips)\n6. **Legal actions**: Only fold or call (no raising allowed)\n\nLooking at the opponent actions history:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been relatively active with raises (hands 67, 69)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has made some raises but also folded to pressure\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) made a big raise to 211, which is essentially an all-in (they have 0 chips now, so they were all-in)\n\nThe action shows:\n- Seat 3 raises to 48 (3x BB)\n- Seat 4 re-raises to 100 (committing most of their short stack)\n- Seat 5 re-raises all-in to 211\n\nThis is a massive multi-way pot with very strong action. The all-in from Seat 5 suggests a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK). Seat 4's 3-bet to 100 also suggests strength. Seat 3's initial raise could be wider but still strong.\n\nWith Kh3d in the SB:\n- No suitedness\n- Very weak kicker\n- Dominated by any other King\n- No straight or flush potential\n\nCalling 203 chips would leave me with only 51 chips (3.2 BB). This is a terrible spot with a terrible hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. Even with a short stack, this hand has terrible equity against the range of hands that are showing this much strength. I need to preserve my remaining 154 chips for a better spot - ideally when I can be the aggressor or at least have a hand with some showdown value.\n\nThe pot is already 383 and it's 203 to call, so I'm getting less than 2:1 odds. Even if I somehow won, I'd only gain 180 chips net (383-203), which isn't enough to justify the risk with this hand. I need to wait for a much better spot.",

But then I'd have ~200 chips behind, which is awkward if someone re-raises.

I'll make a decision based on standard tournament poker: With 16.5 BB and pocket tens UTG, I should raise to ~48 chips (3x). If someone re-raises, I can consider calling if odds are good or shoving.\n\nBut actually, with this stack size, many tournament players would shove with TT UTG. Let me check typical ranges: At 15-20 BB, UTG shoving range is usually 77+, A10s+, KQs, AJo+. TT is definitely in that range.\n\nI'll raise to 48 chips (3x). That leaves me 216 behind, pot would be ~72 after my raise. If someone re-raises, I'll have to decide.\n\nActually, wait - I should use the tools first. But the system says invalid response format.

Let me analyze without tools for now.\n\nI have pocket Tens, facing a re-raise and then a shove. The situation is confusing due to stack sizes and positions. But key facts:\n- My stack: 216 chips\n- Amount to call: 163 chips\n- If I call, I'll have 53 chips left\n- Pot after my call: 383 + 163 = 546 chips\n- I'm getting pot odds: need to call 163 to win 546, which is about 1:3.35, or need ~23% equity.\n\nWith pocket Tens, against ranges that include re-raises and shoves, my equity might be marginal. Seat 4 has only 73 chips, so they're likely all-in or nearly all-in. Seat 5 has 0 chips but raised to 211 - this is weird; maybe they're all-in from previous hand? Actually \"out\" means eliminated, so maybe they're not in the hand? But they raised... This is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should consider tournament situation: I have 13.5 BB. Pocket Tens is a strong hand. Folding would leave me with 216 chips (13.5 BB). Calling could potentially triple up or bust.\n\nLet me think about ranges:\n- Seat 4 (73 chips) raised to 100: likely strong hand, maybe pairs 88+, AJ+, maybe wider since short stack.\n- Seat 5 (0 chips) raised to 211: if they're actually all-in, they might have a very strong range (JJ+, AK).\n\nMy Tens might be behind. But pot odds are decent. However, if I call and lose, I'm down to 53 chips (3.3 BB), which is desperate. If I fold, I still have 13.5 BB, which is playable.\n\nGiven the confusion about seat positions and stacks, and the fact that I'm getting decent pot odds but risk being dominated, I should probably call. Pocket Tens is too strong to fold for 163 into 383 pot, especially with only 13.5 BB effective stack.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that Seat 4 has only 73 chips, so their effective stack is 73. Seat 5 has 0 chips? Actually if Seat 5 has 0 chips, their raise is meaningless; they can't have chips. Maybe they're all-in from antes? Not sure.\n\nLet me assume Seat 5 is all-in for some amount. The pot is 383. If I call 163, I'm all-in effectively (leaving 53 chips). Then Seat 4 calls with 73 total? They already put in 100? Wait they have 73 total, so they can't put in 100. This is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, I think the safe play is to call. Tens are strong, and I'm getting good pot odds. If I lose, I still have 53 chips (3.3 BB), not completely dead.\n\nI'll call. Let's respond with JSON.",

The exceptional pot odds make this a clear decision to continue with pocket aces. Despite being short-stacked, the potential to win a substantial pot outweighs the risks.

I'm in the Big Blind (BB) position with pocket Aces (Ac As) - this is the best possible starting hand\n2. My stack is 73 chips (4.6 big blinds)\n3. The blinds are 8/16, so the pot is already 546 chips\n4. Looking at the action:\n   - Seat 1: posted small blind (8)\n   - Seat 2: posted big blind (16) \n   - Seat 3: raised to 48\n   - Seat 4 (me): raised to 100\n   - Seat 5: raised to 211\n   - Seat 1: folded\n   - Seat 2: folded\n   - Seat 3: called 163\n\nSo the current situation is that there's been a lot of action with multiple raises. Seat 5 went all-in with 211 chips, and Seat 3 called with 163 more chips. \n\nLooking at my options:\n- Amount to call: 111 (this would be to match Seat 5's raise of 211, but I already have 100 in, so I need to add 111 more)\n- Minimum raise to: 322\n\nMy legal actions are: fold, call\n\nWait, let me re-read this more carefully. The actions show:\n- preflop: Seat 4 raise 100 (this is me)\n- preflop: Seat 5 raise 211\n- preflop: Seat 1 fold\n- preflop: Seat 2 fold\n- preflop: Seat 3 call 163\n\nSo the sequence was:\n1. Seat 3 raised to 48\n2. I (Seat 4) raised to 100\n3. Seat 5 raised to 211\n4. Seat 1 and 2 folded\n5. Seat 3 called 163\n\nNow it's back to me. Since Seat 5 raised to 211, and I already have 100 in the pot, I need to call 111 more to match their raise. \n\nI recognize the critical decision point with pocket Aces. The pot odds are compelling at nearly 5:1, and my hand is exceptionally strong. Despite being short-stacked, the mathematical advantage and hand quality make calling the logical choice. The potential payout significantly outweighs the risk of adding 111 chips to the pot.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Ah Qh on BTN, stack 13.2 BB (211 chips). Blinds 8/16, pot currently 172 (includes blinds and raises). Action: SB posted 8, BB 16, Seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 48 (so 48 total? Actually raise amount 48 means they put 48 total? Usually raise to 48, meaning they added 32 over BB). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) raised to 100 (re-raise). So we face 100 to call, min raise to 152. Our hand is strong (AQ suited). Our stack 211, we can call 100 leaving 111 chips. That's about 5.5 BB left. That's short stack. We are in BTN, we can consider shoving all-in (raise to 211) or calling. But min raise is 152, which is less than stack. Could raise to 152 (minimum raise) or go all-in 211. Considering opponent tendencies: DeepSeek has raised various amounts, sometimes huge (240). MiniMax raises modestly (max 32). Both have short stacks? Not given. Their stacks: Kimi 154, 174; DeepSeek 216; MiniMax 73. MiniMax is short (73 chips). He raised to 100, which is more than his stack? Wait his stack is 73 chips, but he raised to 100? That seems impossible. Actually maybe stacks displayed before action? The table shows MiniMax-M2 - 73 chips (so his stack after posting blind maybe?). But he raised to 100, meaning he must be going all-in (since 73 < 100). So likely his raise is all-in for 73? But the raise amount shown is 100 maybe includes his blind? He posted small blind? No, seat 4 is MiniMax, position after seat3 (UTG?). Actually seat order: SB seat1, BB seat2, seat3 is UTG, seat4 is next (maybe MP). So seat4 hasn't posted blind. So raise to 100 would be his total bet of 100, which exceeds his stack 73, meaning he must be all-in for 73. But the system may allow raise beyond stack, but actual effective amount is his stack. However, we treat as all-in for 73. So pot currently: SB 8, BB 16, DeepSeek 48, MiniMax 73 (all-in). So pot ~145? But they listed pot 172, maybe includes some extra. Anyway, we face a short stack all-in. Our best move: call (i.e., call 73 effective) or go all-in ourselves. Since we have a strong hand, we can call to try to double up. But calling 100 would overcommit to 111 left, still short stack but okay. If we raise to 152, we would be raising more, but we don't have that much chips left (211). Raising to 152 would leave 59 chips, still short. Might be okay to go all-in to maximize equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have 13 BB, short stack, need to pick up chips. AQ suited is premium. We should go all-in (raise to 211) to maximize pressure, but we are already short stack; calling may be enough. However, if we raise to 152 (minimum raise) we could be re-raised? No more players left. So we could just call. But raising all-in may be seen as aggressive but okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise_to must be total amount. Minimum raise is 152, but we could raise to 211 (all-in). That would be a raise, not a call.\n\nGiven short stack and strong hand, I think go all-in (raise to 211). Reasoning: we want to double up, opponents are short (MiniMax all-in). DeepSeek's raise size variable, but likely has strong hand. Still AQ suited dominates many ranges. So go all-in.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 211, reasoning.\n\n",

Q5 offsuit is not a playable hand from UTG in most situations.\n\nLooking at my stack: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nPosition is terrible - I'm first to act after the blinds, meaning I'll be out of position for the entire hand if I continue.\n\nOpponents: We have 4 opponents left to act after me (MiniMax-M2 in CO, GPT-OSS-120B on BTN, plus the blinds). They could easily raise behind me, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding weak hands from early positions (folded K2c from UTG in hand #15, folded 89s from UTG in hand #10). This is consistent with proper tournament strategy.\n\nThe pot odds: Need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand and poor position, pot odds don't justify playing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with marginal hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nLooking at opponent actions from previous hand: They seem fairly standard. No obvious maniacs or super aggressive players based on limited data.\n\nConclusion: This is an easy fold. Q5o from UTG is not playable. I should preserve my stack and wait for better opportunities.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q5o from UTG is unplayable.

Even if I hit a draw, playing OOP will be difficult.\n\nMy recent hands show I've been folding a lot (30 folds out of 36 hands).

Let me analyze the key factors:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 5c Jh is a very weak hand - suited connectors at the bottom end\n- This is essentially a garbage hand with minimal equity\n- The only potential is hitting a straight or flush, but odds are very low\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Kimi-K2 has been quite active with preflop raises (12-16 chip range)\n- They've raised in multiple recent hands, showing aggression\n- This suggests a fairly wide raising range\n\n**Stack & Position Considerations:**\n- I have 138 chips (34.5 BB) - decent stack size\n- In BB position, I'm getting a discount on the call\n- Need to call 8 chips to win 18 chips (2.25:1 pot odds)\n\n**Decision:**\nWhile I'm getting pot odds of about 2.25:1, 5c Jh is simply too weak to play profitably here. Even against a wide raising range, this hand has very little equity. Kimi-K2's aggression suggests they likely have a strong range, and calling with such a weak hand would be a mistake.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot with a stronger hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"5c Jh is a very weak hand with minimal equity. Despite getting 2.25:1 pot odds from BB position, this suited connector at the bottom end doesn't have enough value to call against Kimi-K2's likely strong raising range. Better to wait for a stronger hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this information about Kimi-K2:\n\nLooking at their recent preflop actions:\n- Hand 27: raise 12\n- Hand 28: raise 16  \n- Hand 29-31: fold\n- Hand 32: raise 12, then fold on flop\n- Hand 33-35: fold\n- Hand 36: raise 12\n- Hand 37 (current): raise 12\n\nSo Kimi-K2 has been quite active with raises, but also folding frequently. Their raise sizes seem to be around 12-16 chips, with 12 being common. They seem to be a fairly aggressive player who likes to raise preflop.\n\nNow let me think about my current situation:\n- I'm in the BB with 5c Jh (suited connectors, very weak hand)\n- I have 138 chips (34.5 BB)\n- Kimi-K2 raised to 12 chips preflop\n- I need to call 8 more chips to see the flop\n- The pot is currently 18 chips\n\nWith 5c Jh, I have a very weak hand. This is suited connectors but at the bottom end - 5-2 is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. The only potential is if I hit a straight or flush, but the odds are very low.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is very weak (5c Jh)\n2. Kimi-K2 appears to be a fairly aggressive player who has been raising frequently\n3. I need to call 8 chips to win a pot of 18 chips (getting about 2.25:1 pot odds)\n4. I'm in the BB so I'm getting a discount on my call\n\nHowever, the pot odds aren't great enough to justify calling with such a weak hand against a likely strong range. If Kimi-K2 is raising frequently, their range is likely quite wide, but 5c Jh is still too weak to play profitably here.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot.\n",

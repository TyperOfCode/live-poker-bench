In hand 81 they called 187 which is significant.\n\nGiven my situation:\n- I'm extremely short stacked (2.1 BB)\n- QJo is a decent hand for a short stack shove\n- The pot is already 48, and I have 66\n- If I call 16, I'll have 50 left and be pot-committed\n- I could raise to 64 (leaving me with 2 chips)\n- Or I could just shove all-in for 66\n\nFrom a tournament perspective, with 2.1 BB, I need to make a move soon. QJo on the button is definitely strong enough to shove with this stack size. The opponent is the big stack who can afford to call, but they've shown they can fold preflop too.\n\nThe best play here is to shove all-in. This maximizes fold equity and puts maximum pressure. Even if called, QJo has decent equity against most calling ranges.\n\nLet me think about the raise sizing. Minimum raise is to 64, but I have 66. I should just shove all-in for 66.",

King-7 doesn't have strong playability and is likely dominated by most hands my opponent would raise with.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: From the memory data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been extremely passive, folding in 8 out of their last 10 hands. This makes their raise here quite unusual and suggests they likely have a strong hand or are making a move with a short stack.\n\n**Stack and Tournament Considerations**: \n- I'm at 23.4 BB with 750 chips - a decent stack\n- My opponent is critically short-stacked with only 16 chips (0.5 BB)\n- Even if I call and win, I only gain 16 chips from them\n- If I call and lose, I lose 34 chips (about 1 BB)\n- The risk/reward doesn't justify calling with such a weak hand\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 34 to win 132 chips total, giving me 25.8% pot odds. However, K7o rarely has 25%+ equity against a raising range, especially from an opponent who has been mostly folding.\n\nGiven the weak nature of my hand, the opponent's tight pattern suggesting strength, and the poor risk/reward ratio, this is a clear fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K7 offsuit is too weak to call a raise, especially from a tight opponent. The risk of losing 34 chips for minimal gain (16 chips if I win) doesn't justify calling. Better to wait for a stronger hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7h Kc (King-7 offsuit) - This is a weak hand, especially in early position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Big Blind (Seat 4) - Last to act preflop\n\n3. **Stack situation**: \n   - My stack: 750 chips (23.4 BB)\n   - Opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 16 chips (very short-stacked)\n   - Pot: 98 chips\n   - Amount to call: 34 chips\n\n4. **Opponent's action**: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 66 chips preflop from what appears to be an early position.\n\n5. **From the memory data**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking has been very passive, folding in 8 out of 10 recent hands\n   - They raised once in hand #80 for 122 chips\n   - They just checked in hand #82\n   - This opponent seems to be playing very tight/passive\n\n6. **Key considerations**:\n   - I have K7o - a weak hand that doesn't play well out of position\n   - The opponent is very short-stacked (16 chips) and has been mostly folding\n   - This raise seems unusual given their tight pattern\n   - With only 16 chips, they're likely going all-in or very committed\n   - I need to call 34 to win a pot of 98 + 34 = 132 chips\n   - Pot odds: 34/132 \u2248 25.8%\n   - But this is K7o - even if I call, I'm likely dominated or behind most hands they'd raise with\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**:\n   - I'm at 23.4 BB - decent stack but not huge\n   - The opponent is almost busted (16 chips = 0.5 BB)\n   - Even if I call and win, I only gain 16 chips from them\n   - If I call and lose, I lose 34 chips (about 1 BB)\n   - The risk/reward doesn't justify calling with such a weak hand\n   \nI'll fold the hand, recognizing the marginal value and unfavorable position. The weak King-7 offsuit doesn't offer enough potential to justify calling, especially against an opponent who has been playing tightly. The minimal chip gain doesn't compensate for the risk of losing chips in this scenario.\n",

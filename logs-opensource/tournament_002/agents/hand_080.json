I have:\n1. A decent hand with an Ace\n2. Fold equity against both opponents\n3. Position advantage\n4. Critical stack size that needs action\n\nThe minimum raise is 32, but with my stack size, I should go all-in for 122 chips. This puts maximum pressure on both opponents and gives me fold equity, which I need with a marginal hand like A9o.",

Td 2c is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. Even though I'm getting a discounted price because I'm in the big blind, this hand has very little equity and potential.\n\nThe opponent has been folding a lot, which suggests they might be tight, but now they're making a raise. This could mean they have a strong hand or they're trying to steal with position.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is extremely weak (Td 2c)\n2. I need to call 106 chips into a pot that would be 268 chips total (146 current pot + 122 raise)\n3. I'm out of position for the rest of the hand\n4. The opponent has been folding a lot, suggesting they might have a real hand this time\n\nThe pot odds are 106/268 = about 39.5%, which means I need to win about 40% of the time to break even. With Td 2c, I'm unlikely to win that often, especially out of position.\n\nIn tournament play, especially with a decent stack (34+ BB), I should be selective with my hands and preserve my chips for better spots.

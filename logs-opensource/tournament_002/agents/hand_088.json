I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n3. **Pot odds**: There's 96 in the pot, I need to call 32. That's 3:1 pot odds\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active, with a mix of raises, calls, and folds\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 3.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory\n- I cannot afford to call and then fold later - if I play this hand, I should be prepared to go all the way\n- 3d 4c is not a hand I want to risk my tournament life on\n\n**Pot odds analysis:**\n- Calling 32 to win 96 gives me 3:1 immediate odds\n- Even with these odds, 3-4 offsuit is just too weak\n- I'd need to hit a straight or two pair to have any chance, and the odds of that are very low\n\n**Opponent tendency:**\n- MiniMax-M2 has shown they can raise preflop (hand 79, 88)\n- They've also folded preflop several times\n- No clear pattern of being overly aggressive or passive\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. While the pot odds are decent, my hand is terrible and I'm too short-stacked to mess around with marginal spots. I need to preserve my chips for a better opportunity - ideally with a stronger hand or in a blind vs blind situation where I can shove with fold equity.\n\nIf I were to raise, minimum raise to is 96, which would leave me with only 2 chips. That's essentially an all-in. But I don't want to shove with 3-4 offsuit.\n\nThe correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot.",

They tend to fold a lot preflop (hands 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 81, 85, 87 all show folds)\n2. When they do raise, it's often substantial - 122 chips in hand 80 and 66 chips in hand 83\n3. They seem to be somewhat aggressive when they do play, with a mix of checks and bets\n\nNow let me analyze my current situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Jc Qd (Jack of clubs, Queen of diamonds)\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - excellent position\n**Stack**: 718 chips (22.4 BB)\n**Opponent**: Kimi-K2 Thinking with 98 chips (3.1 BB)\n**Action**: Facing a call of 16 chips (they posted the big blind)\n\nThis is queen-jack suited connectors, which is a decent hand, especially in position. With JQ, I have:\n- Straight potential\n- Flush potential \n- Good kicker value\n- Can make top pair\n\nGiven that:\n1. I'm in position (button)\n2. My opponent has been folding a lot recently\n3. They have a short stack (3.1 BB)\n4. The hand is playable with JQ\n5. I have a good stack to work with\n\nI think this is a good spot to raise. A raise to around 64 chips (2x the big blind) would be reasonable. This gives me:\n- Value from weaker hands they might call with\n- The opportunity to take down the pot preflop\n- Good position post-flop if called\n\nHowever, I need to consider that they have a short stack. If they have a decent hand, they might push all-in. But given their folding tendency, I think a standard raise is appropriate.\n\nLet me raise to 64 chips.\n",

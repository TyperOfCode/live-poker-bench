            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Ah Tc (Ace of hearts, Ten of clubs)\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n**Stack**: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n**Blinds**: 2/4\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**To call**: 4 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ah Tc is a decent hand but it's offsuit and from early position, it's marginal. This is typically a fold from UTG in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players behind me who can act. If I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by better hands.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have a decent stack at 46.5 BB, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Recent Opponent Behavior** (from the recall):\n   - MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB) has been calling raises and playing post-flop (called 8 preflop, called 20 and 50 on flop/turn in hand 24)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been aggressive (raised to 8 preflop in hand 24, then bet 20 and 50 on flop/turn)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3, SB) has been folding a lot\n   - Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been folding and raising occasionally\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 46.5 BB, I'm in decent shape. Playing marginal hands from early position is a recipe for losing chips unnecessarily.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1 odds. That's not particularly relevant here since it's just the big blind.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold from UTG. Ah Tc is too weak to open from early position. If I raise, I'm likely to get action from better hands. If I call, I'm playing a marginal hand out of position against multiple opponents. The best play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThis is especially true given that MiniMax-M2 in the BB seems to defend their blind and play post-flop, so if I raise, I'm likely to get called and play a big pot out of position with a marginal hand.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nPosition: SB with T9 suited (clubs)\nStack: 199 chips (49.8 BB)\nAction: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB)\nAmount to call: 10 chips (since we already posted SB of 2)\nPot: 18 chips currently\n\nFrom opponent data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times: hand 21 (12), hand 22 (12), hand 25 (32)\n- This is a 3x raise which seems to be his standard opening size\n- He seems to be fairly active preflop\n\nMy hand: T9s is a decent speculative hand from SB, but facing a raise. The suited connector has good implied odds if we hit a flop hard, but we're out of position which is a big disadvantage.\n\nPot odds: We need to call 10 to win 18 (current pot) + 10 (our call) = 28. That's about 1.8:1 odds, or 35.7% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands), T9s has about 40-42% equity. However, being out of position reduces our effective equity significantly. We'll have to act first on every street.\n\nTournament considerations: We have a healthy 50BB stack, so not desperate. Folding here preserves our stack.\n\nAlternative: We could 3-bet, but T9s isn't a great 3-betting hand, especially out of position. We'd be bluffing with a hand that has decent equity but not great.\n\nGiven the out-of-position disadvantage and the fact that we're not getting great pot odds (need ~36% equity but out of position reduces effective equity), I think fold is correct. We can find better spots with position.\n\nLet me check if there's any specific read on Kimi-K2's postflop play. The search didn't show much, but from the action recall, he seems to continuation bet (hand 22 he bet 20 on flop after raising preflop). So he's likely to c-bet which puts pressure on us out of position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Their recent actions suggest they're not playing extremely tight or loose.\n\nThe key factors in my decision:\n\n1. **Pot odds**: I'm getting 8 chips to call into a pot that will be 39 chips (18 current + 12 raise + 8 call + 1 SB). This gives me excellent pot odds of about 4.9:1.\n\n2. **Hand strength**: Ace-high has decent playability and can improve to strong hands postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: At 33+ BB, I can afford to see a flop with a playable hand rather than being forced to fold.\n\n4. **Position**: While I'm out of position, the cheap price makes this call attractive.\n\n5. **Raise size**: The 3x blind raise doesn't suggest an extremely strong hand, making Ace-high more competitive.\n\nGiven these factors, calling with Ace-high from the BB at these pot odds is the most profitable play. I can fold easily if the flop doesn't help me, but I have good equity when I hit an Ace or other strong combinations.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Excellent pot odds (4.9:1) with Ace-high from BB. The 3x raise doesn't suggest premium strength, making my Ace offsuit competitive. Stack size allows for seeing a flop with this playable hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the information I've gathered:\n\n1. My hand: Ac 8d - This is Ace offsuit, which is a decent hand but not premium. Ace-high can be strong, especially from the BB position where I get to see the flop cheaply.\n\n2. My stack: 133 chips (33.2 BB) - I'm in the middle range of stack sizes. Not short-stacked but not deep either.\n\n3. The situation: \n   - I'm in the BB with 4 chips already invested\n   - Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 has raised to 12 chips (3x the blind)\n   - I need to call 8 more chips to see the flop\n   - Minimum raise would be to 20 chips total\n\n4. Kimi-K2's preflop tendencies from the data:\n   - In the last 15 hands, they've shown a mix of actions\n   - They've made several raises (hands 12, 21, 22, 25) with amounts varying from 6 to 32\n   - They've also called (hands 17, 20) and folded frequently\n   - Their raise amounts vary significantly, suggesting they might be adjusting to different situations\n   - Most recently they raised to 32 in hand 25, then folded in hand 26\n\n5. Analysis of my hand strength:\n   - Ace offsuit is playable, especially from the BB\n   - I'm getting good pot odds to call (8 chips to win 18 chips already in pot, plus their 12 chip raise)\n   - If I call, the pot would be 18 (current) + 12 (their raise) + 8 (my call) + 1 (SB) = 39 chips\n   - So I'm calling 8 chips to win 39 chips, giving me pot odds of about 4.9:1\n\n6. Tournament considerations:\n   - I'm not short-stacked (33+ BB), so I can afford to see a flop with a playable hand\n   - Ace-high has decent playability postflop\n   - If I hit an Ace, I could potentially win a big pot\n   - If I miss, I can easily fold to continued aggression\n\n7. Position considerations:\n   - I'm out of position, which is a disadvantage\n   - However, I'm getting a good price to call\n\n8. Alternative actions:\n   - Fold: Would lose my 4 chips already invested\n   - Call: See the flop for 8 more chips\n   - Raise: Would require raising to at least 20 chips total (16 more), which is a significant portion of my stack\n\nGiven the pot odds (4.9:1) and the strength of Ace-high, calling seems like the most reasonable action. Ace offsuit has good playability and I'm getting a good price to see the flop. The raise size of 3x the blind seems reasonable and doesn't suggest an extremely strong hand.\n\nI should call and see the flop, then make decisions based on what comes.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation carefully. Let me understand the current state:\n\n1. I'm in the Big Blind (Seat 4) with Ac 8d\n2. My stack is 109 chips (27.2 BB)\n3. The board is Qs 8h Jd 7h Kh\n4. The pot is 58 chips\n5. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the only remaining opponent with 182 chips\n6. It's the river, and I have the action (amount to call is 0)\n7. Legal actions are fold, check, raise (minimum raise to 16)\n\nLet me analyze my hand:\n- I have Ace of clubs and 8 of diamonds\n- The board shows: Qs 8h Jd 7h Kh\n- I have one pair - a pair of 8s (since I have 8d and 8h is on the board)\n- But this is a very weak pair considering the board has Q-J-K which are high cards\n- My Ace high is likely not good since there's a King on the board\n\nLet me think about what my opponent might have:\n- They raised preflop to 12\n- They bet 16 on the flop when I checked\n- They checked the turn when I checked\n- Now on the river, they're facing my action\n\nGiven that they checked the turn, they likely don't have a very strong hand. If they had a strong hand like top pair or better, they probably would have bet on the river to extract value.\n\nMy options:\n1. Check - This would showdown the hand. With Ace high and a weak pair of 8s, I'm likely losing to most hands that called preflop and stayed to the river.\n2. Raise - I could try to bluff, but my hand is very weak and I don't have much of a stack to work with (109 chips). A minimum raise to 16 would be small, but it might get called by weaker hands.\n3. Fold - This isn't an option since there's no bet to call.\n\nGiven that:\n\n\nI'll likely check to see the showdown. My hand is mediocre, with Ace high and a weak pair of 8s. The board suggests higher cards are present, making my hand vulnerable. Bluffing seems risky with my limited chip stack, and betting would only add more chips to a pot where I'm probably behind. Checking allows me to minimize losses while potentially catching my opponent with a weaker hand.\n",

With a King on board, my Ace high is very weak. The board has high cards (Q-J-K) so my pair of 8s is likely behind most reasonable holdings.\n\n2. **Opponent's Pattern**: From the recall, I can see Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has checked multiple times before - on flops and turns. This suggests they might be a more passive player or waiting for strong hands.\n\n3. **Opponent's Turn Check**: The fact that they checked the turn after betting flop suggests they don't have a strong hand. If they had a strong hand like top pair or better, they likely would have bet the turn for value.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm in the big blind, so I have position on the river. I can check and see if I can win at showdown.\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: With 109 chips (27.2 BB), I have a decent stack. I don't need to make risky moves to stay alive.\n\n**Decision**: \n- I should check and hope to win at showdown with my Ace high\n- My hand is too weak to value bet\n- Raising would be a bluff, but with the board being so high and my weak hand, this would be a very bad bluff\n- The minimum raise is 16 chips, which would be committing too much with such a weak hand\n\n\nChecking allows me to minimize risk and potentially win with a marginal hand. The passive opponent's betting pattern suggests they might not have a strong hand either. By checking, I can avoid unnecessary chip expenditure and potentially steal the pot at showdown if their hand is weaker than mine.\n",

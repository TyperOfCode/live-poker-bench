I'm out of position for the entire hand. The initial raiser (Seat 4) and caller (Seat 5) are still to act after me if I call. They could potentially 4-bet or call.\n\nThe 3-bet size is 12 total (6 BB). That's a significant raise. With A5s, I have some speculative value but facing a 3-bet, my hand is weak. The suited ace gives me flush potential, but I'm dominated by many better aces.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 23 + 10 = 33. That's about 30% pot odds. My equity against a typical 3-betting range might be around 25-30% at best. But I'm out of position and could face further action.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (99 BB). No need to take marginal spots, especially out of position.\n\nI should fold. Let me check if there's any history on these players, but the system says I need to respond with JSON. I'll make a decision based on basic poker principles.\n\nAction: fold. Reasoning: A5s out of position facing a 3-bet is too weak. Poor pot odds and positional disadvantage make this an easy fold.

Let's see: Board 7-3-5-K, I have A-9. I need 6 for 3-4-5-6-7 straight (but I have A-9, not 4). Actually 6 gives 3-4-5-6-7 straight but I don't have 4. T gives 5-6-7-8-9? No. Actually not many straight draws.\n- Basically just ace-high on K-high board\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 2 to win 10 (8+2) = 20% pot odds\n- Need ~20% equity to call\n\n**Equity Estimate:**\n- Against a king: ~5% equity (ace-high vs Kx)\n- Against a pair like 7x, 5x, 3x: ~15-20% equity (6 outs to pair ace)\n- Against a draw: maybe 30-40% equity\n- Against complete bluff: ~60%+ equity\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\n- Small 25% pot bet on turn after checking flop\n- Could be probing bet with weak hand\n- Could be value bet with weak king or pair\n- Could be draw (flush draw with Ks on board)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- 98 BB stack - can afford speculative calls\n- Position advantage on river\n- Small investment (2 chips = 1% of stack)\n\n**Decision:**\nCall seems reasonable. Small price to see river, maintain position, and potentially bluff if checked to on river. Fold would be tight but not terrible given weak hand. Raise seems bad with no real hand strength.\n\nI'll call.",

That's four diamonds total. I have a flush! Yes, I have a diamond flush with Ace high? Actually Ace is clubs, so my highest diamond is 9. So I have a 9-high flush. Board has 7d, 3d, 4d, plus Ks and 5s. So my flush is 9-high. Could there be a higher flush? Someone could have a diamond higher than 9, like Td, Jd, Qd, Kd, Ad. Ad would be the nut flush. Kd would be king-high flush. But Kd is not on board. So possible higher flushes exist. However, opponent's betting pattern: they checked flop, bet small on turn (2 into pot of 6? Let's reconstruct: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, Seat 2 called 2, I called 1 (SB to BB), BB checked. Pot preflop: 1+2+2+1=6? Actually SB 1, BB 2, caller 2, I call additional 1 (total 2). So pot preflop: 1+2+2+1=6. Flop checked around. Turn: I check, BB bets 2, Seat 2 folds, I call 2. Pot after turn: 6+2+2=10. River brings 4d, completing flush draw. I have flush. Opponent could have been betting a draw on turn, maybe a diamond draw, or a pair. They bet small, 2 into 6, which is a small bet. Could be a probe bet with a weak pair or a draw. Now river completes flush. I should consider betting for value. But I'm out of position? Actually I'm on button, but action order: I'm first to act on river because BB acted last on previous streets? Let's see: On turn, I checked, BB bet, I called. On river, action starts with me (button) because BB acted last on turn? Actually in Texas Hold'em, the player to the left of the button acts first on each street. The button is last to act. I'm seat 3 (button). Seat 4 is BB (to my left). So on flop and turn, seat 4 acted after me. On river, I act first because I'm button? Wait: The button acts last postflop. So after the turn, the button (me) acts last. But the hand history says: turn: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call. So on turn, I checked, then BB bet, then I called. That means I checked first because I was first to act? Actually preflop: SB (seat 3) acted first, then BB, then UTG, etc. Postflop: the player to the left of the button acts first. That's seat 4 (BB). But the hand history shows seat 3 check first on flop and turn. That suggests seat 3 is first to act? Maybe because seat 2 folded? Let's check players: Seat 1 folded preflop, Seat 2 called preflop, Seat 3 (me) SB, Seat 4 BB, Seat 5 folded. After flop, remaining players: Seat 2, Seat 3, Seat 4. The order: Seat 2 is UTG? Actually positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Not sure. But typical order: button is seat 3, SB is seat 3? Actually SB is seat 3, BB is seat 4. So postflop, first to act is seat 2 (UTG), then seat 3 (button/SB), then seat 4 (BB). But hand history says: flop: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 check, Seat 2 check. That suggests"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, and reasoning. I'm on the river with a flush. The pot is 10 chips. I have first action (or maybe not? Let me re-examine: The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet facing me. So I can check or bet. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. So I can check or raise (bet). I have a 9-high flush. Board: 7d 3d 5s Ks 4d. My hand: Ac 9d. I have a flush with 9-high. Possible better flushes: any diamond higher than 9: Td, Jd, Qd, Kd, Ad. Ad is nut flush. Kd is king-high flush. But opponent's betting pattern: they checked flop, bet small on turn (2 into 6). Could be a probe bet with a pair like Kx, or a draw like diamond draw. If they had a diamond draw, they might have bet turn as a semi-bluff. Now river completes flush. If they had a diamond draw, they might have a higher flush if they held a higher diamond. But they might also have a pair and now be scared of flush. I should consider betting for value against weaker hands like one pair, two pair, or smaller flush. But bet sizing? Pot is 10. I could bet small like 4-5 chips, or check to induce a bluff. However, I'm out of position? Actually I'm button, but action starts with me? The prompt doesn't specify order, but \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's my turn to act and there's no bet. So I'm first to act. I could check to induce a bluff from opponent if they have a weak hand, or bet for value. Given the small pot and my medium-strength flush, I think checking might be reasonable to keep pot small and avoid getting raised by a better flush. But I have a flush, which is strong. However, it's only 9-high. There are many better flushes possible. But opponent's range: they're BB, checked preflop, checked flop, bet small on turn. Their range could be wide: any two cards. They could have a king (top pair), a straight draw (6x for open-ended?), a flush draw, or nothing. On river, if they have a weak pair, they might check back. If they have a flush, they might bet. If they have a busted draw, they might bluff. I think betting small for value is good: maybe 5 chips (half pot). If they raise, I can fold. But they might call with worse hands like one pair or two pair. Let me think about stack sizes: I have 194 chips (97 BB). Opponent has 263 chips. Pot is 10. A bet of 5 is reasonable. I'll bet 5. But need to use raise_to as total amount. If I bet 5, that's a raise to 5? Actually \"raise_to\" is total amount I'm putting in. Since amount to call is 0, if I bet 5, I'm raising to 5? The interface might consider a bet as a raise. Legal actions include raise. So I can raise to 5. Minimum raise to is 2. So I can raise to any amount >=2. I'll raise to 5. Let's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand:** Q\u2665 8\u2665  \n**Position:** BTN (Button)  \n**Stack:** 202 chips (101 BB)  \n**Board:** K\u2660 7\u2665 7\u2660 6\u2666  \n**Pot:** 5 chips  \n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) with 166 chips  \n**Action:** Opponent checked to me on the turn, amount to call is 0\n\nMy hand: Q\u2665 8\u2665 - This is a weak hand on this board. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for a straight: 9-7-6-? Actually board is K-7-7-6, so I need a 9 to make 9-8-7-6, but that's not a straight... wait, let me think: Board is Ks 7h 7s 6d. I have Q8. I need 9-10 for a straight? Actually, for a straight I'd need 9-10, but that's two cards. Or I could pair my Q or 8. I have a backdoor flush draw with hearts (7\u2665 on board, I have Q\u26658\u2665, so two hearts). But only one heart on board, so not really a flush draw.\n\nActually, I have a gutshot straight draw to a 9 (9-8-7-6) - that's 4 outs. Also could pair my Q or 8 (6 outs total). So maybe 10 outs total, but some might be dirty.\n\nOpponent: GPT-OSS-120B has shown some passive play in previous hands. In hand #1, they called multiple bets preflop, then called on flop, folded on turn. In hand #2, they folded preflop.\n\nThe pot is only 5 chips. I'm on the button. My hand is weak but I have position. I could try to bluff or semi-bluff with my draws.\n\nGiven the small pot and my weak hand, checking seems reasonable. But I have position advantage and could try to take the pot down with a bet. However, the board is paired (7s) which reduces the likelihood opponent has a strong hand that would call. They might have a K, a 7, or a draw.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing: Minimum raise is 2 chips (total). Pot is 5, so a bet of 2-3 chips would be small. If I bet, I'm representing a K or a 7. But with Q8, I'm basically bluffing.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 101 BB, opponent has 83 BB. Not deep stacked but not short either. Risking a small amount to win 5 chips might be okay.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: I have position and the pot is tiny. Checking might be fine to see a free river card. But if I bet small (2 chips), I might get a fold from hands like small pairs, A-high, etc. And if called, I still have some outs on river.\n\nI'll check and see a free river. No need to bluff into such a small pot when I have position and can evaluate river.",

There's also a flush draw that missed (spades and hearts didn't complete), and a straight draw with 8-9 or 9-T would have missed.\n\nThe opponent checked to me on the river after checking all streets. This could mean they have a weak hand, maybe a busted draw or a weak pair. I have top pair, but with a weak kicker. Since the opponent checked, I could check back to show down, or I could make a small bet for value if I think they'll call with worse hands.\n\nI should check my opponent's tendencies first.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the river with Qh8h. The board is Ks 7h 7s 6d Qd. I have a pair of queens with an 8 kicker. The board shows a pair of 7s on the flop, and I hit my queen on the river. My opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) checked to me on the river after checking through the flop and turn.\n\nLooking at the search results for GPT-OSS-120B: In hand #1, they folded to a turn bet with A5s on a 5c6d2s7d board. In hand #2, they folded preflop from the SB with Ac9d. So they seem somewhat cautious.\n\nThe pot is only 5 chips. I have top pair with queen, but my kicker is weak (8). However, the board has a pair of 7s, so there's a possibility of trips or a full house, but unlikely given the action. My opponent checked three streets, so they likely have a weak hand.\n\nGiven that I'm in position and my opponent has shown weakness by checking all streets, I should value bet my pair of queens. The pot is small, so I should make a small bet to get value from worse hands like weaker queens, 8s, or maybe even a bluff catcher.\n\nI have 202 chips (101 BB), so a small bet of 4-6 chips (2-3 BB) seems reasonable. I'll go with 5 chips, which is pot-sized. This should get called by worse hands but fold out better ones.\n\nLet me check: amount to call is 0, minimum raise to is 2. So I can raise to any amount from 2 up to my stack. I'll raise to 7 (putting in 5 more chips). Actually, wait - if I raise, I need to specify the total amount. Currently I have 0 in the pot (I called preflop 2). So if I want to bet 5 chips, I need to raise to 7 total (2 already in + 5 more).\n\nBut actually, I should check the action: I called preflop 2, then checked flop and turn. So I have 2 chips already invested. To bet 5 chips, I need to put in 5 more, making total 7. Yes.\n\nI think a bet of 5 chips (half pot) is good. Let me do that.",

Currently in BB.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has been active, raising and calling preflop, betting on later streets.

With J6s UTG, this is a clear fold in tournament poker. The reasons:\n1. Hand strength: J6s is very weak UTG. Even suited, it's dominated by many better hands.\n2. Position: UTG is terrible position - I'll have to act first on every street.\n3. Stack preservation: With 103.5 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n4. Tournament considerations: Early in tournament with deep stacks, I should play tight from early positions.\n5. Multiple players behind: 4 players left to act (SB, BB, and two others), increasing chance someone has a better hand.\n\nThe pot odds are 2 to call into 3 pot (1.5:1), but implied odds are poor with this hand from UTG.\n\nI should fold and wait for better spots.",

The raise is small - only a min-raise from SB. This could be a wide range from SB trying to steal blinds.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips to win 8 chips in the pot (2 from SB, 2 from BB, plus 4 more from SB's raise). That's 2:1 pot odds, or 33% equity needed.\n\nSet mining implied odds: If I hit a set on the flop (about 11.8% chance), I could potentially win a big pot. With 205 chips effective stacks, if I call 4 now, I'd have 201 left. If I hit a set, I could potentially win opponent's 189 chips.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent tendencies.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 5s. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 total (so 4 more for me to call). The pot is 8 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 5 raise). I have 205 chips (102.5 BB). Looking at opponent history: Seat 2 has mostly folded preflop (folded 4 out of 5 hands, called once). This is their first raise. They raised from SB after 3 folds, so they could be raising light from the small blind.\n\nPocket 5s is a medium pocket pair. In the BB facing a SB raise, I have good pot odds: need to call 4 to win 8, so 2:1 odds. That's 33% equity needed. Against a typical SB raising range, 55 has about 55-60% equity. So calling is profitable. However, I should consider raising for value or to take initiative. But pocket 5s is vulnerable to overcards on flop. Given opponent's tight history (mostly folding), their raise might be stronger than typical SB range.\n\nBut I have position advantage (BB vs SB) - I'll act last postflop. With 102.5 BB deep, implied odds are good if I hit a set (7.5:1 odds to flop a set, need ~12:1 implied odds). The raise is small (3x BB), so I'm getting good direct odds too.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to fold preflop, they might be raising with a decent hand but could fold to a 3-bet. However, 55 is not a great 3-bet bluff hand since it has decent showdown value. I think calling is best - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set, and if I miss, can fold to aggression.\n\nLet me check: legal actions are fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 10 (total). I could raise to 10-15, but with 55 and opponent's tightness, they might call or 4-bet with better hands. Calling seems optimal.\n\nDecision: Call. Reason: Good pot odds (2:1), pocket pair has decent equity against SB raising range, position advantage, good implied odds if we hit a set, and opponent has shown tight tendencies suggesting their raise may be stronger than typical SB range, making 3-bet risky.",

          "content": "I'm in the small blind with 5s Js. The action: UTG+1 (Seat 2) raised to 6 total (so a raise of 4 more over the BB). I need to call 5 to continue. My stack is 200 chips (100 BB). The pot is currently: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 = 9? Wait, SB 1, BB 2, raise 6 = total 9. Actually, Seat 2 raised to 6 total, which includes the call of BB 2? Let's think: Blinds 1/2. SB posts 1, BB posts 2. Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 folds. Seat 2 raises to 6 total. That means they put in 6 chips total, which is a raise of 4 over the BB (since BB is 2). So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 = 9 chips. I need to call 5 more (since I already put in 1 as SB). My stack after posting SB is 199? Actually I started with 200, posted SB 1, so I have 199 left. To call 5, I'd have 194 left.\n\nThis is a marginal hand: J5 suited. Not strong. However, I'm in the SB, so I get to act last postflop if I call? Actually, after the flop, the betting order is SB first (since BB is the only other player?). Wait, there's BB (Seat 4) still to act after Seat 2's raise. So there's BB left to act. If I call, then BB can call, raise, or fold. If BB calls, then three players see flop: SB (me), BB, and Seat 2. Postflop, the order is SB first (since SB is left of BB? Actually, the order postflop is the first active player left of the button. The button is Seat 5? Wait, no button indicated. Typically button is Seat 5? The positions: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 UTG+1, Seat 3 SB, Seat 4 BB, Seat 5 Button? Actually, in 5-handed, positions: Seat 5 is button, Seat 1 SB, Seat 2 BB, Seat 3 UTG, Seat 4 UTG+1? But the hand says: Seat 3 is SB, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is folded. So button must be Seat 5 (since SB is Seat 3, BB is Seat 4). So postflop, the first to act is the player left of the button, which is Seat 1 (folded), then Seat 2, then Seat 3 (me), then Seat 4. But since Seat 1 folded, the first to act is Seat 2 (UTG+1). Actually, need to confirm: In typical 5-handed, button is Seat 5, SB is Seat 1, BB is Seat 2, UTG is Seat 3, UTG+1 is Seat 4. But here they list Seat 3 as SB, Seat 4 as BB, Seat 5 folded. So maybe the table is 5-handed but positions are different. Anyway, I'll assume postflop I'll act after the raiser (Seat 2) if BB folds. If BB calls, I'll act first? Actually, if BB calls, there will be three players: SB (me), BB, and Seat 2. The order postflop is first active player left of the button. Button is Seat 5 (folded). So first active left of button is Seat 1 (folded), then Seat 2, then Seat 3 (me), then Seat 4. So Seat 2 acts first, then me, then BB. That's good: I get to see what Seat 2 does before I act.\n\nNow, hand strength: J5 suited is not great, but suited connectors can have implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. However, J5 suited is a gap of 3, not a connector. It's a weak suited hand. In the SB facing a raise, usually fold. But let's consider stack sizes: I have 100 BB, opponent has 195 (97.5 BB). The raise is to 6 (3 BB). Pot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9 (current pot) + 5 (my call) + maybe BB call? Actually, if I call, pot becomes 14 (9+5). Then BB can call 4 more (since BB already put 2, needs to call 4 more). If BB calls, pot becomes 18. My investment is 5. Pot odds: 5 to win 9 currently,"

          "reasoning_content": "I'm in the small blind with 5s Js. The action: UTG+1 (Seat 2) raised to 6 total (so a raise of 4 more over the BB). I need to call 5 to continue. My stack is 200 chips (100 BB). The pot is currently: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 = 9? Wait, SB 1, BB 2, raise 6 = total 9. Actually, Seat 2 raised to 6 total, which includes the call of BB 2? Let's think: Blinds 1/2. SB posts 1, BB posts 2. Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 folds. Seat 2 raises to 6 total. That means they put in 6 chips total, which is a raise of 4 over the BB (since BB is 2). So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 = 9 chips. I need to call 5 more (since I already put in 1 as SB). My stack after posting SB is 199? Actually I started with 200, posted SB 1, so I have 199 left. To call 5, I'd have 194 left.\n\nThis is a marginal hand: J5 suited. Not strong. However, I'm in the SB, so I get to act last postflop if I call? Actually, after the flop, the betting order is SB first (since BB is the only other player?). Wait, there's BB (Seat 4) still to act after Seat 2's raise. So there's BB left to act. If I call, then BB can call, raise, or fold. If BB calls, then three players see flop: SB (me), BB, and Seat 2. Postflop, the order is SB first (since SB is left of BB? Actually, the order postflop is the first active player left of the button. The button is Seat 5? Wait, no button indicated. Typically button is Seat 5? The positions: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 UTG+1, Seat 3 SB, Seat 4 BB, Seat 5 Button? Actually, in 5-handed, positions: Seat 5 is button, Seat 1 SB, Seat 2 BB, Seat 3 UTG, Seat 4 UTG+1? But the hand says: Seat 3 is SB, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is folded. So button must be Seat 5 (since SB is Seat 3, BB is Seat 4). So postflop, the first to act is the player left of the button, which is Seat 1 (folded), then Seat 2, then Seat 3 (me), then Seat 4. But since Seat 1 folded, the first to act is Seat 2 (UTG+1). Actually, need to confirm: In typical 5-handed, button is Seat 5, SB is Seat 1, BB is Seat 2, UTG is Seat 3, UTG+1 is Seat 4. But here they list Seat 3 as SB, Seat 4 as BB, Seat 5 folded. So maybe the table is 5-handed but positions are different. Anyway, I'll assume postflop I'll act after the raiser (Seat 2) if BB folds. If BB calls, I'll act first? Actually, if BB calls, there will be three players: SB (me), BB, and Seat 2. The order postflop is first active player left of the button. Button is Seat 5 (folded). So first active left of button is Seat 1 (folded), then Seat 2, then Seat 3 (me), then Seat 4. So Seat 2 acts first, then me, then BB. That's good: I get to see what Seat 2 does before I act.\n\nNow, hand strength: J5 suited is not great, but suited connectors can have implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. However, J5 suited is a gap of 3, not a connector. It's a weak suited hand. In the SB facing a raise, usually fold. But let's consider stack sizes: I have 100 BB, opponent has 195 (97.5 BB). The raise is to 6 (3 BB). Pot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9 (current pot) + 5 (my call) + maybe BB call? Actually, if I call, pot becomes 14 (9+5). Then BB can call 4 more (since BB already put 2, needs to call 4 more). If BB calls, pot becomes 18. My investment is 5. Pot odds: 5 to win 9 currently,",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more context. Looking at opponent actions: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop in hand #6 to 6 as well, then bet 8 on flop. That suggests they're capable of raising preflop and following through. In hand #2, they called preflop, checked flop, folded turn. In other hands, they folded preflop. So they seem somewhat tight but will raise with decent hands.\n\nMy hand: J5 suited is weak. In the SB, facing a raise from UTG+1, I should generally fold. However, let's consider pot odds: I need to call 5 to win current pot of 9. That's pot odds of 5:9, or 1:1.8, meaning I need about 35.7% equity. J5s vs a reasonable raising range (say top 20%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo) has about 30% equity. So not quite enough. Plus implied odds: if I hit a flush or straight, I could win more, but J5s is a weak suited hand - the flush is low, and straight potential is limited. Also, I'm out of position postflop (I'll act after the raiser but before BB if BB calls). Actually, if BB calls, there will be three players: Seat 2 acts first, then me, then BB. So I'm in middle position, which is okay.\n\nBut overall, this is a fold. The hand is too weak, and calling 5 (2.5 BB) with J5s from SB facing a raise is not profitable. Better to preserve my stack. I have 100 BB, no need to play marginal hands from out of position.\n\nLet's also consider tournament implications: early in tournament, I should play tight, especially from SB with weak hands. Folding is correct.\n\nThus, I'll fold.",

So they're not super aggressive but have shown some raising activity.\n\nMy hand: 6d4d is a suited connector, but a weak one (6-4 suited). On the button, I have position advantage, which is valuable. However, this is a very weak hand. Suited connectors need good implied odds to play, and calling 6 chips (3BB) with a hand that needs to hit a flop hard is questionable.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 9 chips (1SB + 2BB + 6 raise). I need to call 6 to win 9, so pot odds are 6:9 or 1:1.5 (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have 40% equity against a typical raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 100BB stack, healthy. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nPosition helps, but the hand is just too weak. Even with position, 64s is a bottom-tier suited connector. Better to fold and wait for better spots.\n\nLet me also check if there are any other players to act after me: Seat 4 (SB) and Seat 5 (BB) still to act. They could reraise, making my call even worse.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised to 6 chips (3x BB). From the recall data, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop to 6 chips in the last 3 hands (hands 6, 7, 8). This suggests they might be raising frequently or have a wide opening range.\n\nHowever, my hand is very weak. J2 offsuit doesn't play well against a raise. I'm out of position (SB) which makes playing this hand even worse. I would need to call 5 chips into a pot that will be 9 + 5 = 14 chips if I call, giving me pot odds of about 5:14 or 1:2.8.\n\nBut the real issue is implied odds - with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to hit a flop that gives me a strong hand. Even if I hit a J, I could be dominated by better jacks. The 2 is almost useless.\n\nAlso, I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands from out of position.\n\nThe BB (Seat 4) is still to act behind me, so there's additional risk of a squeeze.\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's frequent raising, they might be stealing, but J2 is still too weak to defend with from the SB. I should fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J2o is a very weak hand from SB out of position.

The small blind (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2) and big blind (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act after me. I have position on both of them.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been folding a lot preflop recently (folded last 3 hands). Called once preflop in hand 9, then played postflop. Seems somewhat tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded every hand preflop for the last 9 hands! Extremely tight player.\n\nMy hand: Qd 3d is not a great hand, but it's suited and I'm on the button. With both opponents showing tight tendencies, I could consider stealing the blinds. However, Q3s is borderline for this.\n\nMy stack: 200 chips (100 BB) - healthy stack.\nPosition: Button is the best position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 3 chips (1.5:1 odds). That's good pot odds, but the hand quality matters.\n\nIf I raise, I could potentially steal the blinds given opponent tendencies. If I call, I'm playing a weak hand out of position against the blinds who could check or bet.\n\nLet me think about tournament strategy: I have a healthy stack, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks. But I also want to accumulate chips. The button is a good spot to apply pressure.\n\nGiven the extreme tightness of GPT-OSS-120B (BB folding 9 straight hands) and MiniMax-M2's recent folding streak, a raise might be profitable. However, Q3s is really weak - if called, I'll often be dominated.\n\nBetter to fold this marginal hand and wait for better spots. The pot is small, and I have position on future hands.\n\nWait, actually I should check if there are any antes. No antes mentioned, just blinds 1/2.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Q3s is too weak even on the button against two opponents, even if they're tight. I'd rather wait for a better hand to attack their blinds.\n\nLet me respond.",

Being on the button gives me positional advantage, but Q3s is still very marginal. With 100 BB stack, I should be careful. Let me think about typical button opening ranges. Q3s is probably too weak to open-raise from button in most strategies.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with Qd 3d, which is a suited queen but with a weak kicker. The action has folded to me preflop. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise from the button position.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2. I'm on the button, which is the best position. With Q3 suited, it's a speculative hand - suited connectors have good implied odds but Q3 is not a great suited hand.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the small blind with 233 chips, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the big blind with 163 chips. I need to recall how these opponents play from the blinds when facing a button raise.\n\nSince I can't use tools due to format issues, I'll rely on general poker strategy. From the button with Q3s, standard play would be to raise to steal the blinds, especially since everyone has folded to me. However, Q3s is quite weak - even suited, it's not a great hand. The suited aspect gives some postflop potential.\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 2 to see the flop. If I raise, minimum raise to is 4 (total). \n\nConsidering stack sizes: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is healthy. The blinds have 233 and 163 chips respectively. A small raise to 4-6 chips (2-3x BB) could work as a steal attempt.\n\nHowever, Q3s is really weak. Even from the button, this hand has limited postflop playability. The suited aspect helps, but Q3 will often be dominated by better queens or make weak pairs.\n\nGiven the deep stacks (100 BB), I might prefer to either fold or make a small raise. Calling from the button with Q3s is not great because I'll be out of position against the blinds postflop if they call.\n\nI think the best play is to make a small raise to try to steal the blinds. If called, I have position and can potentially bluff or make a hand. Q3s has some flush potential.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips total (a 3x raise from the BB). This is a standard button raise size.",

Kx, Tx, maybe some pocket pairs. My Qd 3d has very little equity unless I hit a diamond or a queen.\n\nI should probably check back and see a free turn card. My backdoor draws give me some potential, but not enough to bet for value. A bluff might work sometimes, but with two players in the hand and a K on board, it's risky.\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have access to the recall tools due to format issues, but generally, blind defenders can have wide ranges. They called a button raise, so they could have many hands.\n\nPot odds: If I bet 9 chips into 18, I need them to fold 33% of the time for a pure bluff to be profitable. With two players, that's less likely.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (97 BB). No need to take big risks with weak hands.\n\nI think checking is best. Let me see a free turn card and re-evaluate. If I hit a diamond or queen on turn, I might have some playability.\n\nDecision: Check.",

But folded preflop last 3 hands. Called my preflop raise this hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded preflop a lot (7 of last 10 actions). Called my preflop raise this hand.\n\n**My preflop action:**\n- I raised to 6 (3x BB) from BTN with Q3s. This is a standard button steal attempt.\n- Both blinds called.\n\n**Flop action:**\n- Board: K\u2663 T\u2666 5\u2665\n- Both checked to me, I checked behind. This was reasonable with just a backdoor flush draw and weak hand.\n\n**Turn action:**\n- Turn: 9\u2666 giving me a flush draw\n- Both opponents checked to me again\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a flush draw with 9 outs (~18% chance to hit on river)\n2. Pot is 18 chips, I could bet for value/protection\n3. Position advantage - I get to see river action first\n4. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking twice\n5. My image: I raised preflop from BTN, could represent a strong hand\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see river. Safe but gives up potential fold equity.\n2. **Bet**: Semi-bluff with flush draw. Could get folds from weak hands. If called, I still have outs.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Both opponents seem weak (checked twice)\n- Pot is small (18 chips)\n- I have position\n- A bet of 10-12 chips (about 2/3 pot) could work well\n- If I get called, I still have good equity with flush draw\n- If I get raised, I can fold (though unlikely given their passivity)\n\nI think a semi-bluff bet makes sense here.

The board shows Kc Td 5h 9d 3h. I have Qd 3d, so I have a pair of threes, queen kicker. No flush possible for me (I have diamonds but board has only 2 diamonds). Opponent checked to me on river.\n\nPot is 42 chips. I bet 12 on turn, opponent called. Now they check river. I need to decide whether to bet again or check behind.\n\nLet me think about hand strength: I have bottom pair with weak kicker. Board has K, T, 9, 5, 3. What could opponent have? They called preflop from SB after my raise, then called my turn bet. They could have draws that missed, weak kings, maybe middle pair, maybe a flush draw that didn't come in (only 2 diamonds on board). The river brought a 3h, giving me trips actually - wait no, I have Qd 3d, board has 3h, so I have two pair: threes and... actually I have a pair of threes, not two pair. Board has 3h, I have 3d, so I have trips! Actually yes: I have pocket 3, board has 3, so I have three of a kind! That's strong.\n\nWait: I have Qd 3d. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d 3h. So I have a pair of threes, but board has a 3, so that makes three of a kind! Yes, I have trips: 3d + 3h on board. So I have trips threes. That's a strong hand. What beats me? Higher trips (K, T, 9, 5 trips), straights (QJ would make straight, but board is K T 9 5 3, so QJ would be KQJT9 - that's a straight! Actually QJ would make a straight: K Q J T 9. Yes, QJ makes a straight. Also J8 makes straight: T 9 8 5 3? No, J8 would need 7. Actually J8 doesn't make straight. Let's check: Board K T 9 5 3. Straights possible: QJ makes KQJT9. Also 87 makes T9875? No. 76 makes 98765? No 6 on board. So only QJ makes a straight. Also two pair or flush not possible.\n\nSo I have trips threes. That's likely the best hand unless opponent has QJ for straight or higher trips (KK, TT, 99, 55). But those are less likely given preflop action. Opponent called from SB after my raise, so they could have suited connectors, small pairs, etc.\n\nThey called turn bet on 9d turn. Now river is 3h, giving me trips. They check. Should I bet for value? Probably yes, as trips are strong. But need to consider if they'll call with worse. They might have a king, maybe T9, maybe pair of tens or nines. They might call a small bet.\n\nBut also need to consider my image: I raised preflop from BTN, checked flop, bet turn. Could be seen as continuation bet. Now river improves me. I should bet for value.\n\nHowever, need to recall opponent tendencies. Let me use tools to see opponent's behavior. First, who is opponent? Seat 4: MiniMax-M2. Let me recall their actions.",

The river brought the 3h, giving me a pair of threes.\n\nOpponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) checked on the river. I need to decide whether to check or bet/raise. Let me think:\n\n1. Hand strength: I have bottom pair (3s) with Q kicker. This is a weak hand on this board. The board has K, T, 9, 5, 3. There are straight possibilities (QJ would make a straight, J8 would make a straight). My hand is likely only beating bluffs or worse pairs.\n\n2. Opponent behavior: MiniMax-M2 called my turn bet of 12 after checking twice (flop and turn). They called from the small blind position. Their range could include: Kx hands, Tx hands, 9x hands, flush draws, straight draws, or maybe even slow-played strong hands.\n\n3. Pot odds: Pot is 42 chips. If I bet, I need to consider what worse hands might call. Given my weak hand, value betting seems questionable.\n\n4. Tournament considerations: I have 182 chips (91 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n5. Opponent history: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 seems to be somewhat active - betting on flop in hand 8, calling and betting in hand 9. They folded preflop in last few hands. Their turn call suggests they have something.\n\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand, checking back seems prudent. I could consider a small bluff, but with bottom pair and no draw, it's risky. The opponent called my turn bet, so they likely have at least a piece of the board. A river bet might get called by better hands and fold out worse hands.\n\nBetter to check and see what they have, preserving my stack. Let me check.",

It's dominated by any hand with a king, and 2c is a weak kicker. In tournament play, especially from early position, we should be folding weak hands like this.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any opponent tendencies or tournament dynamics that might change this. However, the system is telling me I need to respond with JSON immediately. Let me think:\n\n1. Hand strength: Kh 2c is very weak, especially from UTG\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first postflop\n3. Stack size: 112 BB is deep, so I can afford to be patient\n4. Tournament considerations: No need to take unnecessary risks with such a deep stack\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3, but that's not good enough for such a weak hand\n\nStandard play here is definitely to fold. Even if I were in later position, K2o is a fold. From UTG, it's an easy fold.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to play this hand. Maybe if opponents are very tight or passive?

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format, but first I should think about the situation. I'm in the BB with 5d 6c. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 6 total (so 4 more to call). I have 222 chips (111 BB). The pot is 9 chips. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nFirst, let me consider my hand: 5d 6c is a suited connector, but it's offsuit here. It's a speculative hand that plays well in multiway pots, but this is heads-up against a raiser. In the BB, I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 9, which is 2.25:1 odds, or about 31% equity needed. Against a typical raising range from UTG (Seat 1 is UTG?), actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let me check: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is BB (me), Seat 4 is UTG? Wait, the positions: Seat 1 is first to act preflop? Actually, with 5 players: Seat 1 is UTG, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is BB, Seat 4 is Button? Actually, the table order: Seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Seat 4 and 5 folded. So Seat 1 is UTG, raised. So it's a UTG raise.\n\nUTG raising range is typically tight: maybe top 15-20% of hands. 56o has about 30% equity against a top 15% range. Actually, let me estimate: 56o vs top 15% (22+, A2s+, K9s+, QTs+, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s, 65s, AJo+, KQo) has about 32% equity. So I have roughly the required equity based on pot odds alone.\n\nBut there are other factors: position disadvantage (I'll be out of position postflop), stack sizes (I have 111 BB, opponent has 205 chips = 102.5 BB). Implied odds: if I hit a strong hand (two pair, straight, etc.), I can win more chips. Reverse implied odds: if I hit a marginal hand like a pair of 5s or 6s, I could lose a lot.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (111 BB), so I can afford to take a speculative call. However, being out of position with a weak hand is not ideal.\n\nI should also consider opponent tendencies. Let me try to recall opponent actions, but the tool calls are failing. I need to respond in JSON format. Maybe I should just make a decision based on general principles.\n\nGiven the pot odds (31% equity needed) and my hand's approximate 32% equity against a tight range, it's a borderline call. However, being out of position reduces my postflop profitability. In tournament poker, defending the BB with 56o against an UTG raise is generally a fold at these stack depths (111 BB). At shorter stacks (like 20-30 BB), calling becomes more attractive due to implied odds being better relative to stack sizes.\n\nAlso, the raise size is 3x BB (6 total, so 4 more over my BB). That's a standard raise.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. I'll save my chips for better spots. Let me craft the JSON response.",

So I need to call 1 more to match the BB of 2. Pot is 5 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 2 call). I have 221 chips (110.5 BB). My hand is terrible: 4h7s offsuit, not connected, not suited. In the small blind, I could complete with some speculative hands, but 74o is one of the worst hands. I'm getting 5:1 pot odds (call 1 to win 5). That's good odds, but the hand is so weak that I'll likely be dominated postflop. I'm out of position against the BB (Seat 4) and the caller (Seat 2). The BB could raise, making my call wasted.\n\nI should consider folding. However, I recall that in tournaments, sometimes completing the SB with any two cards can be okay if getting good odds. But 74o is really bad. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I can use tools to recall opponent actions. Let me first search for observations about these opponents.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the small blind with 4h 7s, which is a very weak hand. The pot is 5 chips (1 from my SB, 2 from BB, and 2 from Kimi-K2's call). I need to call 1 more chip to complete the blind.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 7, 8, 12). In hand 7, they raised to 6 from early position. In hand 8, they raised to 6 from UTG. In hand 12, they raised to 6 from UTG. So Kimi-K2 seems to be an aggressive player who raises preflop with decent hands.\n\nHowever, in this hand, Kimi-K2 just called from UTG (seat 2). That's interesting - they didn't raise. This might indicate a weaker hand than their usual raising range. They're the only player in the pot besides me and the BB.\n\nI have 4h 7s - this is a terrible hand, especially out of position. I'm in the small blind, which means I'll be first to act postflop. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 1 chip to win a pot of 5 chips (if BB folds) or 6 chips (if BB calls). That's 5:1 or 6:1 pot odds. However, with such a weak hand and being out of position, these pot odds aren't great.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 221 chips (110.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. Kimi-K2 has 185 chips. The BB has 214 chips.\n\nGiven my weak hand, being out of position, and the fact that I'd be playing against at least one opponent (Kimi-K2), folding seems correct. Even though it's only 1 chip, 4h7s is just too weak to play from the small blind, especially when we have to act first on every street.\n\nThe BB might raise behind me, which would put me in an even worse spot.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for better opportunities. Let me check if there are any other factors... The search shows I've been folding to Kimi-K2's raises in previous hands (hands 7, 12). That's consistent with good play.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is the SB and has been fairly tight - folded 3 of 4 hands preflop, but did call once and bet on flop once. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is BB and has folded a lot preflop too (folded 4 of 5 hands preflop, called once).\n\nThe blinds are small relative to stacks (110.5 BB effective). With K5o on the button, this is a marginal spot. The button is a great stealing position, but K5o is weak. However, both blinds seem fairly passive/foldy preflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 5 (3 in pot + my 2 call), so I'm getting 2.5:1 odds, which is decent.\n\nBut raising might be better to try to steal the blinds. Minimum raise to 4 would be putting in 4 to win 3, which is worse odds but could win it outright.\n\nGiven my position and opponent tendencies, I think a small raise could work. If I get called, I have position and a King-high hand that might be best if they have weak holdings.\n\nHowever, K5o is really weak. The King is good but the 5 is a terrible kicker. If either blind has any decent hand, I'm in trouble.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. My stack is healthy at 110.5 BB, no need to play marginal hands.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament strategy. With deep stacks, I can be more selective. K5o is not a hand I want to play, even on the button. The risk of getting called by a better hand and playing out of position postflop (well, actually I'd have position) isn't worth it.\n\nI should fold.",

That's pot odds of 2:1 (16:8), but I need to consider implied odds and reverse implied odds.\n\nSince I'm in the BB defending against a SB raise, I might normally defend wider, but T6o is just too weak.

I need to call 10 chips (since I already put in 2). My stack is 215 chips (53.8 BB). Looking at opponent's history: they've mostly folded preflop (6 out of 10 actions), called twice in late positions when facing limps, and raised once previously (hand #21). This is their second raise in recent hands.\n\nKJo is a decent hand, but not premium. I'm out of position (small blind), which is a disadvantage. The opponent has shown some recent aggression with two raises in a row. The pot is currently 18 (my 2 SB + BB 4 + raise 12). If I call, I put in 10 more for a total pot of 28.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and KJo is marginal, but the opponent might be widening their range, I could consider a 3-bet to take initiative. However, with 53.8 BB stack, I need to be careful. A 3-bet to around 28-30 total might be reasonable. Let me check if raising is a legal action - yes, it is.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's history: they raised last hand (hand #21) and now raised again. This could indicate they're getting active. KJo has decent equity against a wide range. I could 3-bet to test their strength or call and play cautiously postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have a healthy stack, but not huge. Folding is too weak. Calling is okay but puts me out of position. Raising could win the pot now or define their hand.\n\nI think a small 3-bet to 28 total (adding 26 more) is reasonable. That would make it 16 more for opponent to call. If they're raising light, they might fold. If they call, I have initiative and can c-bet on favorable flops.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise to: 20 total. So I need to raise to at least 20. 28 seems good. If they 4-bet, I can fold. If they call, I have position disadvantage but initiative.\n\nActually, I'm in SB, so I'll be first to act postflop. That's even worse. Maybe just call or fold. But KJo is too strong to fold for 10 more chips. I'll call and play cautiously.\n\nWait, I should consider the BB behind me. BB hasn't acted yet (Seat 4). They still need to act after me. So if I call, BB might squeeze. That's another consideration.\n\nGiven all this, I think calling is the most balanced approach. I'll see the flop and decide. If BB squeezes, I can fold.\n\nLet me decide: call.",

The current situation is preflop, I'm in the BB with 6s Qc facing a raise from Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) to 12 total, so I need to call 8 more. My stack is 201 chips (50.2 BB). Let me think about this hand.\n\nFirst, my hand: 6s Qc is a weak hand - Queen-high with a low kicker, offsuit. Not a strong starting hand. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 4 chips. The raise is to 12, so I need to call 8 more to see a flop.\n\nPot odds: Pot is currently 18 (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8, so pot odds are 8 to win 18, which is about 2.25:1 or 31% equity needed.\n\nBut I should consider opponent tendencies. The opponent is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" - seems like an AI opponent. Without specific history, I should assume standard play. A raise from UTG (Seat 1) could be a decent range.\n\nWith Q6o, I'm dominated by many hands in a UTG raising range. Even if I hit a Queen, I could be outkicked. The hand has little potential for straights or flushes.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 50 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\nI should probably fold. But let me check if there's any reason to call. In the BB, getting 2.25:1 odds, but with such a weak hand that plays poorly postflop, it's likely -EV.\n\nBetter to preserve chips for better spots. Q6o is a clear fold against an UTG raise.\n\nMy action: fold.\n\nNow I need to output JSON.",

The suited connector has good implied odds if we hit a flop hard, but we're out of position which is a big disadvantage.\n\nPot odds: We need to call 10 to win 18 (current pot) + 10 (our call) = 28. That's about 1.8:1 odds, or 35.7% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands), T9s has about 40-42% equity. However, being out of position reduces our effective equity significantly. We'll have to act first on every street.\n\nTournament considerations: We have a healthy 50BB stack, so not desperate. Folding here preserves our stack.\n\nAlternative: We could 3-bet, but T9s isn't a great 3-betting hand, especially out of position. We'd be bluffing with a hand that has decent equity but not great.\n\nGiven the out-of-position disadvantage and the fact that we're not getting great pot odds (need ~36% equity but out of position reduces effective equity), I think fold is correct. We can find better spots with position.\n\nLet me check if there's any specific read on Kimi-K2's postflop play. The search didn't show much, but from the action recall, he seems to continuation bet (hand 22 he bet 20 on flop after raising preflop). So he's likely to c-bet which puts pressure on us out of position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to understand opponent's raising patterns. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop frequently: 6 chips (1.5x) in early hands, then 12 chips (3x), and recently 32 chips (8x) in hand 25, and 12 chips (3x) in hand 27. In hand 27 they showed Kd9d, so they're raising with suited connectors and likely a wide range.\n\nMy hand: Qs3s - suited queen with weak kicker. I'm on the button, which is good position, but facing a raise from seat 2 (UTG? Actually seat 2 is likely UTG or MP depending on table size). Let me check table positions: Seat 1 folded (UTG?), seat 2 raised (UTG+1?), I'm BTN (seat 3), seat 4 is SB, seat 5 is BB.\n\nThe raise is to 16 chips (4x BB). My stack is 199 chips (49.8 BB). Pot is currently: SB (2) + BB (4) + raise (16) = 22. I need to call 16 to win 22, giving me 1.375:1 pot odds (42% needed). Q3s vs a likely wide range has maybe 35-40% equity? Actually against a reasonable UTG range, Q3s has ~35% equity. Against a wider range it could be better.\n\nBut position is key: I'm on button, so I have position postflop. However, there are still SB and BB to act after me. They have short stacks (MiniMax-M2 has 107 chips, GPT-OSS-120B has 262 chips). SB might call or fold, BB might defend.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49.8 BB, which is healthy. Q3s is a marginal hand. Facing a 4x raise from UTG, even with position, it's questionable. The opponent has shown willingness to raise with speculative hands like K9s, so their range might be wider than typical UTG.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've played similar spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Ks Ah on a 7h Td 4d board. I raised preflop to 16 and Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called. Now on the flop, the pot is 38 chips, and it's my action with amount to call = 0 (so I can check or raise). I have AK offsuit, which is top pair top kicker on this board. The flop is 7h Td 4d, giving me a pair of tens with ace kicker (actually board has Td, so I have top pair with ace kicker). There's a flush draw with two diamonds, but I have no diamonds.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 91 chips total, so they have a short stack. They called my preflop raise from presumably the button or cutoff? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, seat 5 is SB, seat 1 is BB? Let me check: Seat 5 posted SB 2, Seat 1 posted BB 4, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 (me) raised to 16, Seat 4 called 16, Seat 5 folded, Seat 1 folded. So Seat 4 is in the cutoff or maybe button? Actually seat numbering: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3: me (BB), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2, Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (folded). So after me (BB), action goes to Seat 4 who called. That means Seat 4 is UTG? Wait, typical order: SB (seat 5), BB (seat 1), then UTG (seat 2), etc. But here Seat 1 is BB, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 (me) raised from... actually I'm seat 3, but I'm BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So I'm the big blind. Then Seat 4 is UTG? Actually after BB, it goes to UTG (seat 2), but seat 2 folded. Then seat 3 (me) acted? Wait, I'm seat 3, but I already posted BB? The preflop actions: Seat 5 post_sb 2, Seat 1 post_bb 4, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 raise 16, Seat 4 call 16, Seat 5 fold, Seat 1 fold. So I raised from the BB after the BB was posted by Seat 1? That's confusing. Maybe Seat 1 is actually the BB, but I'm seat 3? Let's assume I'm BB (seat 3) and Seat 1 is something else. Anyway, not critical.\n\nImportant: I have top pair top kicker on a dry board except for flush draw. My opponent called preflop raise. They could have a wide range: pairs, suited connectors, maybe Ax, KQ, etc. They have a short stack (91 chips). The pot is 38, and I have 183 chips (45.8 BB). They have about 22.75 BB.\n\nI should consider betting for value and protection. I want to charge flush draws and weaker hands. Since they have a short stack, they might be willing to go all-in with draws or pairs. I should bet maybe 2/3 pot to 3/4 pot. Minimum raise to is 12, meaning I can bet any amount from 12 up to my stack.\n\nBut first, let me use tools to recall opponent tendencies. I'll search for MiniMax-M2 actions.",

We raised preflop to 16, got called by seat 4 (MiniMax-M2). We bet 25 on the flop, and they called. Now on the turn, we have 158 chips total, opponent has 66 chips total (short stack). Pot is 88 chips. We have position (BB vs seat 4 who is presumably button? Actually seat 4 is to our left, so we're out of position? Let me check: seats: 1 folded, 2 folded, 3 is us (BB), 4 is MiniMax, 5 folded. So we're BB, seat 4 is UTG or MP? Actually with 5 players, seat 4 is CO? Wait, we need to reconstruct: 5 players total, seat 5 was SB, seat 1 was BB, seat 2 folded, we (seat 3) raised, seat 4 called, seat 5 (SB) folded, seat 1 (BB) folded. So we're seat 3 (BB) and seat 4 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 5 SB, seat 1 BB, seat 2 UTG, seat 3 us (BB? Wait we're seat 3, but we posted BB? Actually hand says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So seat 3 is BB, seat 4 is UTG? That seems weird. But anyway, we're out of position relative to seat 4.\n\nOur hand: AK offsuit. Board: 7h Td 4d Th. We have ace high with a backdoor flush draw (spades, but board has diamonds). Actually we have Ks Ah, so we have no flush draw. We have overcards: Ace and King. The board is paired tens, so there's trips possible. Opponent called preflop and flop. What could they have? Looking at their history: They've shown down Tc9s (ten-nine suited) in hand 24, and Ac8d in hand 27. They seem to call with a variety of hands. They called preflop with our raise to 16. That's 4BB raise. They have 66 chips total, so they's short-stacked (16.5BB). They called 25 on flop (pot was ~40? Actually preflop pot: our 16 + their 16 = 32, plus blinds 2+4 = 6? Wait SB 2, BB 4, but SB folded, BB folded. So pot preflop: 16+16+2+4 = 38. We bet 25, they called, pot becomes 88. They have 66 chips total, they've put in 16+25 = 41 already, leaving 25 chips behind. So they're effectively pot-committed.\n\nOur stack: 158 chips, we've put in 16+25 = 41, leaving 117 behind.\n\nOn turn, we can check or raise (minimum raise to 25, but we can bet any amount up to all-in). Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Or we can bet for value/protection.\n\nWhat hands do we beat? If opponent has a lower pocket pair (like 99, 88, etc), we're ahead. If they have a ten, we're behind. If they have a draw (like diamonds), we're ahead but vulnerable. They could have a smaller ace (A7, A4, AT maybe). AT would be trips. A7 would be two pair (sevens and tens). A4 would be two pair (fours and tens). They could have a pocket pair below ten.\n\nGiven they called preflop and flop, they likely have something decent. Could be a ten, could be a draw, could be a medium pair.\n\nWe have 6 outs to improve to a pair (3 aces, 3 kings), but some of those might not be clean if opponent has a ten (an ace or king would give us pair but still lose to trips). Actually if opponent has a ten, we need two pair or better. If we hit an ace or king, we'd have one pair, still losing to trips. So we need to hit runner-runner for two pair or trips. Not great.\n\nBut we might have the best hand now. Let's consider pot odds: If we bet, we can try to get them to fold. They have only 25 chips left, so they're getting good odds to call any bet. If we bet small, they'll likely call with any pair or draw. If we bet all-in (117), they'd have"

          "content": "Let me look at hand 24 and 27 to see how they played. Hand 24 they had Tc9s and called a raise preflop (4BB? Actually they called 4). They called flop bet 20, turn bet 50. Hand 27 they had Ac8d and called preflop raise to 8 (2BB?), called flop bet 16. So they tend to call with marginal hands. They have shown down Tc9s and Ac8d. They're a calling station.\n\nNow our situation: They have only 25 chips left. Pot is 88. If we bet, they're getting great odds to call with any piece. They're pot-committed. If we check, they might bet their remaining 25 on river if they improve or if they think we're weak. But they might check back.\n\nOur hand: AK high on paired board. We're likely behind if they have a ten. But they could have a draw (diamonds), a smaller pair (like 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, etc), or a weaker ace. Given they called preflop raise, their range includes: pocket pairs 22-JJ, suited connectors, broadways, maybe some suited aces. They have 66 chips total, so they's short-stacked and might be playing any two cards hoping to double up.\n\nWe have 117 behind. If we bet, we should consider sizing. Minimum raise is 25, but we can bet any amount. If we bet small like 25, they'll call with almost anything getting 88+25+25=138 pot, they need to call 25, so 5.5:1 odds. They'll call with any pair, any draw, maybe even ace high. If we bet larger, say 50, they still have to call 50 into 138+50=188, needing 3.76:1 odds. They might fold some weak draws but likely call with any pair. If we go all-in 117, they have to call 117 into 88+117=205, needing 1.75:1 odds. They'll call with any pair, any draw.\n\nGiven they're short-stacked and pot-committed, betting might just get them to call with better hands and fold worse hands. Actually, if they have a draw, they might call. If they have a weak pair, they might call. If they have a ten, they'll call. So betting doesn't accomplish much except maybe get value from draws and weaker pairs. But we're not sure we're ahead.\n\nIf we check, we can see what they do on river. They might check back, then we can decide to bluff or value bet on river depending on card. Or they might bet their last 25, and we can call if we think we might be ahead. Pot odds would be 88+25=113, we need to call 25, getting 4.5:1. We'd need ~18% equity. If we're behind to a ten, we have 6 outs (aces and kings) but some might not be clean. If they have a ten, we need two pair or better. So we have maybe 6 outs to pair, but still lose to trips. So our equity vs a ten is low. But if they have a smaller pair, we're ahead and they have maybe 2 outs to improve. So checking might be good to control pot size and avoid committing more chips when behind.\n\nBut we have position? Actually we're out of position? Wait, we're BB, they're seat 4. Who acts first on turn? The player after the dealer? Let's see: preflop action went: seat 5 SB, seat 1 BB, seat 2 fold, seat 3 (us) raise, seat 4 call, seat 5 fold, seat 1 fold. So we're seat 3, they're seat 4. On flop, first to act is seat 4? Actually after preflop, the last aggressor is seat 3 (us). So we act first on flop. We bet, they called. On turn, we act first again? Yes, because we were the last aggressor on flop. So we're out of position. We act first on turn. So we need to decide now.\n\nGiven we're out of position and opponent is short-stacked, I think checking is reasonable. We can check-call a small bet on river if we think we might be ahead. Or check-fold if they bet large (but they only have 25 left). Actually they only have 25 left, so any bet on river will be 25 or less. So we can check-call any river bet getting good odds.\n\nAlternatively, we could bet small like 25 to charge draws, but they might raise all-in (they"

They'll call with any pair, any draw.\n\nGiven they're short-stacked and pot-committed, betting might just get them to call with better hands and fold worse hands. Actually, if they have a draw, they might call. If they have a weak pair, they might call. If they have a ten, they'll call. So betting doesn't accomplish much except maybe get value from draws and weaker pairs. But we're not sure we're ahead.\n\nIf we check, we can see what they do on river. They might check back, then we can decide to bluff or value bet on river depending on card. Or they might bet their last 25, and we can call if we think we might be ahead. Pot odds would be 88+25=113, we need to call 25, getting 4.5:1. We'd need ~18% equity. If we're behind to a ten, we have 6 outs (aces and kings) but some might not be clean. If they have a ten, we need two pair or better. So we have maybe 6 outs to pair, but still lose to trips. So our equity vs a ten is low. But if they have a smaller pair, we're ahead and they have maybe 2 outs to improve. So checking might be good to control pot size and avoid committing more chips when behind.\n\nBut we have position? Actually we're out of position? Wait, we're BB, they're seat 4. Who acts first on turn? The player after the dealer? Let's see: preflop action went: seat 5 SB, seat 1 BB, seat 2 fold, seat 3 (us) raise, seat 4 call, seat 5 fold, seat 1 fold. So we're seat 3, they're seat 4. On flop, first to act is seat 4? Actually after preflop, the last aggressor is seat 3 (us). So we act first on flop. We bet, they called. On turn, we act first again? Yes, because we were the last aggressor on flop. So we're out of position. We act first on turn. So we need to decide now.\n\nGiven we're out of position and opponent is short-stacked, I think checking is reasonable. We can check-call a small bet on river if we think we might be ahead. Or check-fold if they bet large (but they only have 25 left). Actually they only have 25 left, so any bet on river will be 25 or less. So we can check-call any river bet getting good odds.\n\nAlternatively, we could bet small like 25 to charge draws, but they might raise all-in (they",

The river paired the fours, making the board: Ten-Ten-Four-Four-Seven.\n\nMy hand: AK high. I have no pair, just ace-high with king kicker. The board is paired twice, so anyone with a ten or four has at least a full house. A ten would have quads (four tens). A four would have a full house (fours full of tens). A seven would have two pair (tens and fours with sevens).\n\nHand history: I raised preflop to 16, bet 25 on flop, checked turn, opponent checked back. Now river is a 4s, pairing the board.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 seems to be a calling station - called a 50 chip bet on turn in hand 24, called preflop and flop bets in hand 27. They tend to check when checked to.\n\nMy hand strength: I have just ace-high. This is a terrible hand on this board. The only hands I beat are pure bluffs or worse ace-high hands. Given the paired board and opponent's calling tendencies, they likely have at least a pair, possibly a ten or four.\n\nPot odds: Checking is free. If I bet and get called, I'm likely losing. If I bet and they raise, I have to fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 158 chips, opponent has 66 chips. If I bet and get called/raised, I could lose a significant portion of my stack.\n\nDecision: I should check. There's no value in betting with ace-high on this board. My opponent checked back the turn when I checked, suggesting they don't have a strong hand either, but they could have been slow-playing a monster or have a medium strength hand. Checking allows me to see a showdown for free and potentially win if they have nothing.\n\nLet me check if there are any showdowns with this opponent to see what they show up with.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format, but first I want to understand the situation better. Let me think through this hand:\n\nWe're on the river with Ks Ah (Ace-King offsuit). The board is 7h Td 4d Th 4s - it's paired twice (Tens and Fours) with a flush draw that missed. We raised preflop from BB to 16, MiniMax-M2 called from SB with 66 chips total. We bet 25 on the flop, they called. We checked turn, they checked.\n\nNow on the river, we have top pair with Ace kicker (pair of Tens with Ace kicker). The board is double-paired, so there are possible full houses. MiniMax-M2 has only 66 chips total, and they've called our preflop raise and flop bet. They checked back the turn when given a free card.\n\nWe need to decide whether to value bet or check. Let me consider:\n\n1. Our hand: AKo, we have top pair with Ace kicker on a T-T-4-4-7 board. This is essentially a bluff catcher now - we beat any single Ten or lower pair, but lose to any Ten with better kicker (though unlikely given our Ace), any full house (T-T or 4-4), or quads.\n\n2. Opponent's range: They called preflop from SB with a short stack of 66 chips. They called flop bet and checked turn. With only 25 chips left (66 total - 16 preflop - 25 flop = 25 left), they're pot-committed. Their range could include pocket pairs (maybe 77-99, JJ, QQ), suited connectors, Ax hands, maybe some Tens.\n\n3. Board texture: Double-paired board reduces the value of our top pair. Many hands that called flop could have improved to full house on river (any Ten or Four).\n\n4. Stack sizes: We have 158 chips, opponent has 25 left. Pot is 88. If we bet, we should bet small for value against weaker Tens or pocket pairs. But opponent is pot-committed with any decent hand.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: We're at 39.5 BB, healthy but not huge. Winning this pot would be good.\n\nGiven opponent only has 25 chips left, they're likely calling any bet with any piece. A small value bet makes sense - maybe 15-20 chips. But we need to be careful about getting raised all-in if they have a full house.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 7h Td 4d Th 4s. The river paired the 4s. So if opponent has a Ten, they now have a full house (Tens full of Fours). If they have a Four, they have quads. Our hand is weak on this board.\n\nGiven the double-paired board and opponent's line (call preflop, call flop, check turn), they could easily have a Ten or pocket pair that improved. Checking seems safer to avoid getting raised all-in.\n\nBut we also have to consider they might have missed flush draw (diamonds) or straight draw that missed. The board is Td 4d on flop, so diamond draws missed.\n\nI think checking is prudent. We can win at showdown if they have a busted draw or weaker hand, and avoid losing more chips if they have us beat.\n\nLet me respond with check.",

Kimi-K2 (seat 2, BB) has been somewhat active - raising with hands like 25, 27, 28 preflop. They raised to 12, 16, 32 in various hands. They seem to play aggressively when they have hands.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, SB) has mostly folded recently (last 4 hands folded preflop), but did raise in hands 25 and 26.\n\n3. I have 202 chips (50.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 2/4.\n\n4. My hand 9c Ts is suited, which gives some flush potential, but it's a weak hand from UTG. It has some straight potential but is easily dominated.\n\n5. Looking at my recent hand history, I folded 9c Ts in hand 27 when I was SB. That was from a different position though.\n\n6. As UTG, I'm opening into 4 players behind me who could have strong hands. This is a fold in most standard poker strategies.\n\n7. The pot is only 6 chips, and calling 4 chips (2% of my stack) to see a flop with a weak hand from early position isn't great.\n\n8. Raising would be even worse since I'd be bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and position, folding is the correct play. I should wait for better spots to accumulate chips.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors... The minimum raise is to 8, which would commit 4% of my stack. Not worth it with this hand.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7h 3h. This is a very weak hand - suited but with low rank and poor connectivity. The blinds are 2/4, my stack is 202 chips (50.5 BB). Two players have folded, leaving me to act against the small blind (MiniMax-M2, 122 chips) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B, 262 chips).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been fairly active, calling preflop in recent hands (called 8 in hand 32, called 16 in hand 29). Also bet 20 on flop in hand 32. Seems willing to play hands from SB.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded hands 25-32 except hand 30 where they raised to 12). Only one raise in the last 10 hands.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4), and I need to call 4 to see the flop. With position (button) and a suited hand, there might be some speculative value, but 73s is extremely weak.\n\nPot odds: 4 to call into 6 pot = 1.5:1 odds, needing about 40% equity. Against typical SB/BB ranges, 73s has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Implied odds could be better since I have position, but with such a weak hand, I'll rarely make strong enough hands to win big pots.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 50.5 BB stack. No need to take marginal spots with terrible hands. Folding preserves chips for better opportunities.\n\nGiven the weakness of 73s, even with position, I should fold. The small blind might call or raise, and the big blind could check or raise. I'd be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've played similar spots.",

It's a low suited connector with poor high card value. \n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 50.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. The small blind has 30.5 BB and the big blind has 65.5 BB. \n\nWith such a weak hand, folding is probably correct. Even with position, 73s has very little value. The only reason to play it would be to steal the blinds, but with two players behind me who haven't acted yet (SB and BB), and such a weak hand, it's not a good steal candidate.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but with the basic information I have, folding seems right.

I'm first to act preflop after the SB and BB have posted.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 7 hands preflop), but did raise in hands 25 and 26. Currently in BB.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been mostly folding, but raised once in hand 30. Currently in SB.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position to play from. With 93o, this hand has almost no value. It's not suited, not connected, and both cards are low. Playing this from UTG would be a major mistake.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack of 50.5 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands. Better to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nPot odds: It would cost 4 chips to call into a pot of 6 (2 SB + 4 BB). That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but the hand is so weak that even with these odds, it's not worth playing.\n\nI should fold this hand. Let me check if there's any reason to play it - maybe if opponents are very passive? But from the data, opponents have been folding a lot, but that doesn't mean I should play trash hands from UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Stack preservation at 49 BB is important, and this marginal hand can lead to difficult postflop decisions. Better to wait for stronger stealing opportunities.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with Js 9h. Two players have folded, leaving only the small blind (MiniMax-M2 with 136 chips) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B with 262 chips). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop, with the option to raise to at least 8.\n\nLooking at my hand: J9o is a marginal hand, but I'm on the button which is the best position. The players left are the blinds who are forced to put money in. This is a classic steal opportunity.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) has folded to raises several times (hands 28, 35, 36, 37). They called a raise with 64o in hand 32 and then bet the flop. They also called with Ks Ah in hand 29. They seem to play somewhat passively preflop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has raised a few times (hands 30, 35) and folded to raises (hand 28). They have 262 chips, which is the biggest stack at the table.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (49 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so this is a good spot to attempt a steal with position.\n\nHowever, J9o is not a great hand. It's offsuit and has limited connectivity. The standard play here would be to fold marginal hands from early position, but on the button against just the blinds, a raise could be profitable.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Fold: Conservative play with a marginal hand\n2. Call: See a cheap flop with position but give the blinds a free look\n3. Raise: Attempt to steal the blinds, but risk being called by one or both blinds\n\nGiven that the SB has shown some willingness to call raises (hand 29, 32) and the BB has raised a few times, a raise might get called. But with position, I can outplay them postflop.\n\nActually, looking at hand 29, I raised with AKs from CO and got called by MiniMax-M2. So they do call raises sometimes.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips currently. A raise to 12-16 would be standard. If I raise to 12, I'm risking 12 to win 6, needing to succeed about 67% of the time to be profitable. If both blinds fold, I win 6 chips.\n\nBut if I get called, I'll have position with a marginal hand. J9o can hit straights and pairs, but it's not great.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my stack size (49 BB), I think the best play is to fold. J9o is just too weak, even on the button. I should wait for better stealing opportunities with stronger hands or better connectivity.\n\nHowever, some players might argue for a small raise. But looking at my history, I've been folding a lot (31 folds out of 37 hands). Maybe I should be more aggressive. But J9o is really not a good hand to get involved with.\n\nActually, let me check the pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1 odds, or 40% equity needed. J9o has about 35-40% equity against random hands, so calling might be okay mathematically. But then I'm out of position against the SB who acts first postflop.\n\nWait, no - I'm on the button, so I have position against both blinds. The SB acts first, then BB, then me. So I have the best position.\n\nCalling 4 chips to see a flop with position might be okay, but then I'm playing a weak hand out of position relative to the flop betting (SB acts first).\n\nI think the prudent tournament play is to fold. My stack is healthy at 49 BB, no need to risk chips with J9o. I should wait for better spots.\n\nBut let me consider: if I fold, the blinds just get the pot. If I raise, I might steal it. If I call, I see a flop cheaply.\n\nActually, in tournament poker, preserving chips is important. J9o is a trouble hand that can get me into difficult spots postflop. I'll go with fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in UTG position with Qh 3c. This is a very weak hand - Queen-three offsuit. UTG is the worst position to play from, and this hand has very little potential. Looking at my hand history, I've been folding most hands, which is appropriate for my position and chip stack.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (49 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. However, with this weak hand in UTG, I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play post-flop.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the search results: I see Kimi-K2 has raised preflop several times (hands 32, 36, 37). GPT-OSS-120B has also raised preflop (hands 30, 35). So there are aggressive players at the table.\n\nWith Q3o in UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has minimal preflop value, poor post-flop playability, and I'm out of position against the entire table. Even if I hit a Queen, I'll be vulnerable to better kickers. The 3 is essentially a dead card.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with marginal hands, especially from early position. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nPot odds: Would need to call 4 into pot of 6 (2+4), so getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds are poor with this hand since it's unlikely to make a strong hand that can win a big pot.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker strategy - fold weak hands from early position.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7d 3h, which is a terrible hand. My stack is 196 chips (24.5 BB). The blinds are 4/8. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24 from what position? Let me see: Seat 5 is likely UTG or MP? Actually, with 5 players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is... let's count: Seat 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually in 5-handed: Seat 1 is SB? Wait, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm BTN, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is... maybe CO? Let me reconstruct: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3: Me (BTN), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (BB), Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B. So action went: I posted SB 4, Seat 4 posted BB 8, Seat 5 raised to 24, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded. So Seat 5 is UTG or maybe MP? Actually with 5 players, positions: SB (Seat 1), BB (Seat 4), UTG (Seat 2), MP (Seat 5?), BTN (me). Wait, I'm Seat 3 (BTN). So Seat 5 raised from MP or CO? Let's think: If I'm BTN, then SB is Seat 4? No, SB is Seat 1 (folded), BB is Seat 4, UTG is Seat 2 (folded), MP is Seat 5? Actually typical 5-handed: SB, BB, UTG, MP, BTN. So Seat 5 is MP. So MP raised to 24 (3x BB). \n\nI have 7d 3h, which is absolutely trash. I'm on the button, which gives me positional advantage, but with this hand, I should fold. However, let me consider stack sizes: I have 196 chips, opponent has 229. The raise is to 24, which is 12.5% of my stack. If I call, pot becomes 36 + 20 = 56? Actually current pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24 = 36. If I call 20, pot becomes 56. Then BB still to act? Actually BB (Seat 4) already posted BB 8, but hasn't acted yet? Wait, actions: preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 4, Seat 4 post_bb 8, Seat 5 raise 24, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold. So action is on me (Seat 3). BB (Seat 4) still has to act after me. So if I call, BB can still raise. \n\nI should fold this hand. But maybe I can consider a steal? Actually MP raised, so he likely has a decent hand. I could 3-bet bluff? But with my stack size, a 3-bet would be committing. Minimum raise to 40, which would be 36 more (since I've already put 4). That's 20% of my stack. If I 3-bet and get called or 4-bet, I'm in trouble. \n\nBetter to fold. Let me check opponent tendencies though. Use recall_opponent_actions for GPT-OSS-120B. Also maybe search for his raising patterns. Let me do that.",

This 24-chip raise is larger than their previous raises, which might indicate a stronger hand.\n\nWith 7-3 offsuit, I have almost no equity against a raising range. Even if I'm on the button, this hand is simply too weak to play. The pot odds are: I need to call 20 to win 36 (current pot) + 20 (my call) = 56, so about 35.7% pot odds. My hand has nowhere near that equity against a raiser's range.\n\nAdditionally, I have a decent stack of 24.5 BB, and I'm in a tournament. Preserving my stack is important. There's no reason to put chips at risk with such a weak hand.\n\nThe fact that I'm on the button is tempting, but with 7-3 offsuit, I should fold and wait for a better spot.

It's a hand that can rarely make a strong hand, and when it does make a pair, it's often dominated. The pot odds are 8 to call into a pot of 20 (12 + 8), so I'd be getting 2.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand, implied odds are poor.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving stack is important.

SB (MiniMax-M2) posted 4, BB (GPT-OSS-120B) posted 8. UTG and MP folded. I need to call 8 to see the flop.\n\nWith 42o, this is an extremely weak hand - no high card value, no connectivity, no suitedness. It's a trash hand. However, I'm on the button which is the best position post-flop. But still, 42o is just too weak to play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I have a 16.7% win rate and fold most hands (35 folds out of 42 hands). This suggests I'm playing tight. Looking at opponent actions, MiniMax-M2 (SB) has shown some aggression - in hand 42 they called a raise preflop and then bet on the flop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 20 (12 in pot + 8 from me), so I'm getting 2.5:1 odds. But with 42o, even with position, my equity against random hands is terrible - probably around 30% at best. However, I'm only against SB and BB who have posted blinds, so they might have weak ranges too.\n\nBut tournament considerations: I have 24.5 BB, which is a medium stack. I should preserve chips and look for better spots. Playing 42o from the button could lead to difficult post-flop situations where I'm dominated or drawing dead.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better hand. The 8 chips to call is 4% of my stack, but it's not worth it with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The BB (GPT-OSS-120B) hasn't acted yet - they could raise after I call. That would make the situation worse.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

With such a weak hand in early position, I should fold. Playing Q4o from UTG is generally a losing proposition - it's dominated by many better Qx hands, has poor connectivity, and will often put me in difficult spots postflop.\n\nLooking at the tournament situation: I have 24.5 BB, which is a playable stack. I should wait for better spots rather than spew chips with Q4o from UTG.\n\nThe pot is only 12 chips, so I'm not getting great pot odds to call 8 chips. Even if I call, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better opportunity. Let me check if there are any other considerations... The players behind me include MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and Kimi-K2 Thinking. If I call, I could face raises from them.\n\nYes, clear fold. Let me respond with the JSON.",

In tournament poker, especially with 24.5 BB stack, I need to be selective about hands I play from early position.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n1. Fold: Most standard play with Q6o from UTG\n2. Call: Would be 8 chips (4% of my stack) but then I'm playing a weak hand out of position\n3. Raise: Would be very spewy with this hand\n\nGiven the stack sizes: I have 196 chips (24.5 BB), which is a medium stack. The blinds are 4/8. Calling 8 chips is 4% of my stack, but then I'm committing to play a weak hand against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nLet me check if there are any opponent tendencies I should consider. I'll use the recall tools to see if there's any history with these opponents.",

There are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the two Kimi-K2 variants).\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands from various positions. Q6o is definitely a fold from UTG. It's offsuit, weak kicker, and I'm in early position with many players left to act.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with 24.5 BB, I should be looking for better spots. Q6o is not a hand I want to play from UTG. Even if I call 8 chips (4% of my stack), I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to call into a pot of 20 (12 already + 8 from me), so I'd need about 28.6% equity. While Q6o might have some equity against random hands, it's not enough to justify playing from UTG, especially since I'll likely face raises behind me.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Q9 offsuit. The opponent in Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 24 total (16 more for me to call). Looking at the opponent's history, they've folded a lot preflop (14 out of 20 actions are folds). They raised in hand #44 to 48, and in this hand #46 they raised to 24. They also bet on the flop in hand #34. This suggests they might be raising with a wide range when they do play, given their overall tight folding tendency.\n\nMy hand Q9o is not strong, but I'm getting decent pot odds. The pot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24), and I need to call 16 more. That's pot odds of 36:16 or 2.25:1, meaning I need about 31% equity. Against a typical UTG raising range, Q9o has maybe 35-40% equity. But given this opponent's tight folding history, their raising range might be stronger.\n\nHowever, I'm in position (they're UTG, I'm BB). I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Calling 16 chips is about 8.5% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop, I can fold. If I hit something decent, I can potentially win more.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (23.5 BB). The opponent has 154 chips (19.25 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling risks 16 chips but could win a decent pot.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that the opponent might be raising light given their overall tight-passive pattern (lots of folds, only a couple raises), I think calling is reasonable. Raising with Q9o would be too aggressive. Folding is safe but might be too tight given the odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been in similar spots.",

The pot is currently 36 chips (8 from SB, 8 from BB, 20 raise from UTG? Let me calculate: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, UTG raised to 24 total, so that's 24 + 4 + 8 = 36). I need to call 16 to win 36, giving me pot odds of 2.25:1.\n\nQ9 offsuit is a weak hand, especially facing an UTG raise. The opponent has 154 chips (19.25 BB). They raised to 24 (3x BB).

I need to provide JSON response first. Actually, I think the system wants me to make a decision without using tools, or maybe I should use tools but then respond with JSON.\n\nWait, I need to respond with JSON object.

Calling 16 chips (8.5% of my stack) to see a flop with Q9o out of position is not great.

Everyone has folded to me, so I'm facing just the BB who posted 8. I've already posted SB 4, so I need to call 4 more to see the flop.\n\nMy hand is Q2o, which is very weak. However, I'm on the button, which is the best position. The BB has been folding quite a bit recently (folded last 3 hands preflop according to the data). From seat 4's actions, I see they've shown some aggression with raises and bets in previous hands.\n\nBut looking at the situation: I have position, and it's only 4 chips to call to see a flop in a 12-chip pot. That's getting 3:1 pot odds (12:4). However, Q2o is a terrible hand that plays poorly postflop. Even with position, it's hard to make a hand that can win.\n\nGiven my stack size (23 BB), I should be looking for better spots. Folding here preserves my stack for better opportunities. Calling with such a weak hand out of position against a single opponent who might check to me as BB could be okay, but Q2o is just too weak.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern with the BB defending blinds. Looking at the data, seat 4 has shown some aggression but also folded recently. They might check a lot as BB when facing a limp.\n\nActually, wait - I'm on the button, not out of position. I have position on the BB. So if I call, the BB checks to me, I can see a free flop. But still, Q2o is terrible.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Even though it's only 4 chips, it's still 2% of my stack, and I'll likely lose more postflop if I hit a weak pair. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, let me consider raising. I could raise to steal the blinds. But with Q2o, if I get called or 3-bet, I'm in terrible shape. And the BB has 235 chips, so they might defend.\n\nGiven the BB's recent folding trend and my position, maybe a small raise could work. But Q2o is just too weak to raise with. If I had a better hand, I'd consider raising.\n\nSo I'll fold.",

This is a speculative hand - it has potential to make flushes and straights but is weak if I don't hit the flop well.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24 (3x BB). Looking at the opponent data, seat 2 has been folding a lot recently (folded preflop in hands 41-44, 46-48). In hand 45, they called a raise of 40. So this raise from seat 2 might indicate a stronger hand than usual.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (24.5 BB). The raise is to 24, which is 12% of my stack. I need to call 16 more chips (24 total - 8 already in the pot from blinds? Actually I need to call 24 total since I haven't put anything in yet).\n\nPot is currently 36 (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise). If I call, pot becomes 60, giving me pot odds of 24:60 or 1:2.5, meaning I need 28.6% equity to call.\n\nWith 8h9h suited against a typical raising range from early position (maybe 15-20% of hands), my equity is around 30-35% preflop. However, I'm out of position relative to the raiser (seat 2 is likely UTG or UTG+1? Actually seat 2 raised, I'm CO, so I'm acting after them but there are players behind me - seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and seat 5 (SB) still to act).\n\nAlso, I need to consider implied odds - if I hit a flush or straight, I can win a big pot. But I also risk being raised by players behind me.\n\nGiven the opponent's recent folding pattern, this raise might be stronger than usual. My hand is speculative and I'm not in great position. The pot odds are borderline. With 24.5 BB stack, I should be careful about calling raises with speculative hands.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for a better spot. The 24 chips represents 12% of my stack, which is significant for a marginal hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8h9s suited is speculative and opponent's raise suggests strength given recent folding pattern.

If I hit something like a pair or draw, I can continue. Otherwise, I can fold cheaply.\n\nRaising might get a fold, but if called, I'm playing a weak hand out of position with a raised pot. Not ideal.\n\nLet me check: minimum raise to is 16 (total). That's just adding 8 more chips. If I raise to 16, opponent needs to call 8 more.

I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\n**Hand analysis:** I have 5c 9h on a 6s 8c Qc board. This is a weak hand - bottom pair with 9-high. I have a gutshot straight draw (7 would give me a straight), but it's not a great draw. The Q on board is likely to have hit many hands. My 9 gives me bottom pair, which is very weak.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position as BB, which makes it harder to play this hand.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Hand 49: They raised preflop to 24, then bet 48 on flop, then raised to 144 on flop (aggressive play)\n- Hand 50: They called preflop (12 chips), checked flop, folded turn\n- They seem capable of aggressive play but also cautious\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 188 chips, opponent has 152 chips. Both are relatively short (19-23.5 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 23.5 BB, I need to preserve stack but also look for spots to accumulate. This doesn't seem like a good spot to get involved with a weak hand.\n\n**Potential outcomes:** If I check, we see a turn for free. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands or draws that have good equity against me. My hand has very little showdown value and poor equity.\n\n**Decision:** Best to check and see a free turn card. If I hit my gutshot (a 7), I could potentially win a big pot. But betting here with a weak hand out of position is not good. Checking allows me to realize my equity for free and potentially bluff on later streets if the right cards come.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand (bottom pair with 9-high) out of position.

I have 188 chips total (23.5 BB). Opponent has 140 chips.\n\nMy hand: 5c 9h. I have a gutshot straight draw: I need a 7 to make a straight (5-6-7-8-9). There's also a flush draw with clubs on board (6s 8c Qc 4d - two clubs). I have 5c, so I have a flush draw too. Actually, board has two clubs: 8c and Qc. I have 5c, so I have a flush draw with three clubs. That's decent.\n\nPot odds: pot is 28 + 12 bet = 40 total if I call. I need to call 12 to win 40, so pot odds are 12/40 = 30%. My equity: I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs) and a flush draw (9 outs, but need to discount for overlapping). Actually, I have 9 clubs remaining (13 total, minus 5c, 8c, Qc = 10? Wait: 13 clubs total, I have 5c, board has 8c and Qc, so 3 seen, 10 remaining). But some clubs might also be 7c which would give me straight flush draw. However, I need to discount for possible opponent having higher flush draw. But let's estimate: I have about 12-14 outs. That's about 25-30% equity on the turn. Pot odds 30% is close.\n\nBut implied odds: if I hit my flush or straight on river, I might get more chips. Opponent has 140 chips behind, I have 188. If I call 12 now, pot becomes 52.

However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand if I call. The raise is 3x which is standard.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 20 to win 36, so pot odds are 20:36 or 1:1.8, meaning I need ~35.7% equity. Against a typical raising range from UTG+1 (Seat 2), AJo likely has ~40-45% equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23 BB, opponent has 18 BB. This is not a huge stack difference. If I call and BB folds, pot will be 60 with effective stack of ~140 behind (if BB folds). This creates SPR of ~2.3, which is low - postflop will be pot-committed quickly.\n\nPosition disadvantage is significant from SB. However, I could consider 3-betting given my hand strength and opponent's stack size. A 3-bet to ~60 would put pressure on opponent.\n\nLet me check if opponent has folded to 3-bets before.

Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's raising history: they've raised preflop 7 times with varying amounts (8, 12, 8, 8, 24, 16, 48). So they're fairly active, but the 24 raise seems standard. Kimi-K2 tends to call preflop raises fairly often.\n\nWith A4 suited, I have a speculative hand. It's suited with an ace, which gives some potential, but it's a weak ace. In the small blind, facing a button raise and a caller, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 60, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. That's decent. However, I'll be out of position against two players.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. Folding loses my 4 chip SB. Calling 20 chips is about 11% of my stack.\n\nThe hand has some implied odds if I hit a flush or straight, but with A4 suited, I'm mostly playing for flush potential or maybe an ace-high flop.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that I have a suited ace, I could consider calling. However, being out of position is a significant disadvantage. Also, the button raiser might be wide, but the caller indicates some strength.\n\nLet me check if I have any history with similar hands.",

Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 283, but wait, that player has 0 chips and is marked \"out\". That seems odd - a player with 0 chips shouldn't be able to raise. Actually, looking at the stack sizes: Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"out\", meaning they're eliminated. But the action says \"Seat 5 raise 283\". That must be an error or the player went all-in with their remaining chips (which would be 0). This is confusing.\n\nLet me check the situation more carefully. The pot is 307 chips. I posted SB of 8, Seat 4 posted BB of 16. Then Seat 5 raised to 283. But Seat 5 has 0 chips. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the stack display is wrong, or maybe this is a misprint. Alternatively, perhaps Seat 5 had some chips and went all-in, and the \"0 chips\" is a display error.\n\nActually, looking at the amount to call: 275 chips. That's from 283 raise minus my SB of 8? Let's calculate: I already put in 8 as SB. The raise is to 283 total. So I need to call 275 more to make my total 283. My stack is 216 total, so I can't even call 275 - I only have 208 left after posting SB (216 - 8 = 208). Actually wait: my stack is 216 chips. I posted SB of 8, so I have 208 remaining. The amount to call is 275, which is more than my entire stack. So I would be all-in if I call. But the legal actions are only fold or call - no raise option because I can't afford the minimum raise to 550.\n\nGiven that Seat 5 is marked \"out\" with 0 chips, this is very strange. Maybe this is a hand where the player is all-in with less than my stack? Or maybe there's a bug in the display. Let me use tools to gather more information. First, let me search for observations about Seat 5 or similar situations.",

There's a raise to 283 from Seat 5 (who has 0 chips? Wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips according to the player list but just raised 283? That seems odd. Maybe they're all-in? But it says \"raise 283\" and they have 0 chips. Possibly they're all-in with 0 chips left? Actually, looking at the pot size of 307 chips, that includes blinds 8+16=24, plus the raise of 283 makes 307 total. So Seat 5 raised all-in for their remaining stack. They have 0 chips left after posting? Wait, the player list shows \"GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're actually out of the tournament? But they just raised... This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"(out)\" - maybe they're already eliminated but the hand is still being played? Or maybe it's a misprint. Actually, if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. But they did raise 283. So perhaps they had chips and went all-in, leaving 0. The \"(out)\" might mean they're all-in, not eliminated.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: I have 4d 8h offsuit, one of the worst possible hands. I have to call 275 chips into a pot of 307, which means I'm getting about 1.1:1 pot odds. I need to have about 48% equity to call. With 4d 8h against a random hand, I have about 40% equity. Against a typical all-in range, my equity is worse. My stack is 216 chips (13.5 BB), so calling would put me all-in basically (I have 216 total, need to call 275? Wait, I have 216 chips total, but need to call 275? That doesn't add up. Let me recalculate: My stack is 216 chips. I posted SB of 8, so I have 208 left. The raise is to 283 total, and I already put in 8, so I need to call 275 more. But I only have 208 left. So I can't call 275 - I can only go all-in for my remaining 208. So it would be an all-in call.\n\nActually, looking at the numbers: My stack: 216. I posted SB 8, leaving 208. BB is 16. Raise to 283 total. To call, I need to put in 283 total minus my 8 already in = 275. But I only have 208. So I can only go all-in for my remaining 208. That should be allowed as a call.\n\nBut with 4d 8h, this is an easy fold. Even if the opponent is bluffing, my hand is so weak. I'm getting poor pot odds relative to my hand strength. I should fold and preserve my stack of 216 chips (13.5 BB), which is still playable.\n\nLet me check if there's any history on Seat 5's behavior. Use the search tool.",

Actually, looking at the players list: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). So they're out of the tournament but somehow raised? That must be a mistake or they're all-in with 0? Wait, the amount to call is 275, minimum raise to 550. My stack is 216 chips, so I can't even call the 275 - I only have 216 total. Actually, I posted SB of 8, so I have 208 left? Let me check: My stack is 216 chips, I posted SB 8, so I have 208 left. Amount to call is 275, but I only have 208. So I can only go all-in if I want to call. But legal actions are fold, call. So I can call all-in.\n\nBut this is confusing: Seat 5 has 0 chips but raised 283. Maybe they're all-in with their last chips? But they show 0. Possibly a display issue. Regardless, I have 4d8h, a terrible hand. Even against a random hand, my equity is poor. I'm getting pot odds: pot is 307, I need to call 208 (my remaining stack).

Against a reasonable raising range, it's even worse.\n\nBut wait, Seat 5 is out with 0 chips - maybe they're actually all-in with less? If they have 0, then the raise is invalid. This seems like a weird situation. Let me think: The pot is 307 after their raise. That includes my SB 8, BB 16, and their raise 283? That adds up to 307. So they put in 283. My stack is 216, so if I call, I'm all-in for 208 more (since I already put 8). The pot would be 307 + 208 = 515. If I win, I double up to about 432 chips.\n\nBut 4d8h is just too weak. Even with pot odds, it's a marginal call at best. In tournament poker, preserving chips is important. I should fold this trash hand. The fact that Seat 5 is \"out\" but raising suggests maybe they're actually all-in with their last chips, but the display is wrong. Still, with 4d8h, I should fold.\n\nLet me check if there's any history on Seat 5's behavior. Use search tool.",

This might be a display error or they're all-in with their last chips? Let me check the pot size: 307 chips. Blinds 8/16. I posted SB 8, Seat 4 posted BB 16. So initial pot is 24. Then Seat 5 \"raise 283\" - that would be a huge raise. Amount to call is 275, which is my entire stack of 216? Wait, my stack is 216, but amount to call is 275. That doesn't make sense - I can't call more than my stack. Maybe the display is wrong. Let me think: If Seat 5 raised to 283 total, and I have 216, I can only call 216 (go all-in). But the interface says amount to call is 275. Something's off.\n\nLet me check: My stack: 216. Blinds: 8/16. I posted SB 8, so I have 208 left. Seat 4 posted BB 16. Seat 5 \"raise 283\" - if that's total, then to call I need to put in 283 - 8 = 275. But I only have 208 left. So I can't call 275. I must be able to go all-in for 208. The interface might be showing the amount needed if I had enough chips.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 307 chips. That's 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 283 (raise) = 307. Yes. So Seat 5 raised to 283 total. I have 208 left after posting SB. To call, I need to put in 283 - 8 = 275, but I only have 208. So I can only go all-in for 208.

Even though I'm on the button and closing the action (since everyone else folded), calling with 4-8o is terrible. My stack is 216 (13.5 BB). Not super short, but not deep. I should preserve my stack.\n\nPot odds: If I call 208 (all-in), the pot would be 307 + 208 = 515. I'm getting about 2.5:1 odds. But with 4-8o, I'm a huge dog against any reasonable all-in range. Even against a very wide range like any two cards, 4-8o has only about 40% equity. Against a tighter range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 13.5 BB, which is short but not desperate. I can wait for a better spot.\n\nDecision: Fold.\n\nReasoning: 4-8o is a terrible hand to call an all-in raise. Even with button position, the hand has little equity and I should preserve my stack for a better opportunity.\n\nNow respond with JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with KTo, which is a decent hand in late position. My stack is 216 chips (13.5 BB). The blinds are 8/16. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 16. Two players folded, and now it's my action.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) has raised preflop in 4 hands, with amounts 4, 4, 8, 16. These seem like small raises.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has raised preflop aggressively in many hands, including a massive 283 chip raise in hand #62 (which I just folded to in the SB with 4d8h).\n\nLooking at my own hands: I won hand #61 with JcAh by raising 168 chips preflop from BB and everyone folded. My win rate is 16% (10 wins out of 62 hands).\n\nI have 13.5 BB stack, which is short but not critically short. KTo on the button is a playable hand. The BB (GPT-OSS-120B) is aggressive and has shown willingness to 3-bet or raise big. The SB (MiniMax-M2) seems more conservative.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24 (8+16), so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, which is decent.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: KTo isn't a premium hand, but folding on the button with 13.5 BB might be too tight.\n2. Call: See a flop cheaply in position. Good if BB doesn't raise.\n3. Raise: Standard would be to 2.5-3x BB = 40-48 chips. But BB is aggressive and might 3-bet.\n\nGiven BB's aggression (283 chip raise last hand!), raising might induce a big 3-bet that I can't call. Calling might keep the pot small and let me play postflop in position.\n\nActually, with 13.5 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory. KTo might be a decent hand to open-shove with this stack size. Let me think: Standard short-stack strategy says with 10-15 BB, you can shove from late position with a wide range. KTo is definitely in that range.\n\nBut I need to consider the opponents. BB is aggressive and has a big stack (291 chips, ~18 BB). He might call with a wide range. SB has 189 chips (~11.8 BB) and might call.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks: SB has 189 (11.8 BB), BB has 291 (18.2 BB). If I shove 216 (13.5 BB), they need to call 200 and 184 respectively. They might fold medium hands.\n\nBetter to raise to 40-48 and fold to a 3-bet? But with my stack size, if I raise to 48 and get 3-bet, I'll have to fold, losing 48 chips (3 BB). That's significant.\n\nI think shoving might be best. Let me check if there are any hands where opponents called all-ins.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. But first, I should think about the hand. I'm on the button with KTo, 13.5 BB stack. Blinds are 8/16. Two players folded, SB and BB posted blinds. I need to call 16 to play. Minimum raise to 32. I have position being on the button. With KTo, it's a decent hand for late position, but not premium. At 13.5 BB, I'm getting short and should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. Being on the button is advantageous. I should consider raising to steal the blinds. The SB has 189 chips (11.8 BB), BB has 291 chips (18.2 BB). The BB has a bigger stack and might defend wider. But with my stack size, a raise to 32 (2x) would be committing about 15% of my stack. If I get called or raised, I'll have to play postflop with a marginal hand. Alternatively, I could just call and see a flop, but that's not great with KTo out of position against two players. Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I have position against both blinds. That's good. But calling with KTo multiway might not be great either. I should probably raise to try to take it down preflop. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have access to recall tools because I keep getting format errors. But based on general tournament strategy with 13.5 BB, KTo on the button is a standard raise/fold situation. I should raise to about 2.5x (40 chips) or 3x (48 chips). The minimum raise is 32, so raising to 40 is reasonable. If I get called, I'll have position and a decent hand. If I get shoved on, I might have to fold depending on stack sizes. The SB has 189, BB has 291. If either shoves, I'd have to call about 180 more chips if I raise to 40, which would be a big commitment. Actually, if I raise to 40 and SB shoves for 189 total, I'd have to call 149 more into a pot of about 269 (24+40+189). That's about 1.8:1 odds, needing about 35% equity. Against a shoving range of maybe 77+, AJ+, KQ, I have about 35% with KTo. It's close. But I'd rather not get into that spot. Maybe a smaller raise to 32 (min-raise) could work. But min-raises often get called more. I think standard play is to raise to 2.5x-3x and fold to a shove. With my stack, I could also consider shoving myself. But KTo might be a bit weak for a 13.5 BB shove from the button. Usually shoving ranges from button with 13.5 BB include hands like A2s+, A8o+, K9o+, QTo+, JTs, etc. KTo is probably in the lower end of that range. But shoving has the advantage of not facing difficult decisions postflop. However, if I shove for 216, the SB would have to call 208 into pot of 240 (24+216), needing about 46% equity. They might call with a decent range. BB would have to call 200 into 256, needing about 44%. They might call even wider. I think a raise/fold might be better. Let me check legal actions: I can fold, call, or raise. I think raising is best. I'll raise to 40 (2.5x). If I get shoved on, I'll likely fold unless I get a great price. Let me provide the JSON.",

Raising would be even worse - I'd be putting more chips in with a terrible hand.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 15 BB, which is getting short but not critical yet. Preserving my stack is important. There's no reason to play this trash hand from UTG.\n\nI should check if there are any opponent tendencies that might change my decision, but with J2o from UTG, it's a clear fold regardless.\n\nLet me provide the JSON response.",

The action: I posted SB 8, BB posted 16, then seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 48 total, seat 1 folded, seat 2 raised to 118 total. Wait, seat 2 is listed as \"Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" but they raised? That seems odd - maybe they're all-in with 0? Actually seat 2 has 0 chips but raised to 118? That must be an error or they're all-in with their remaining stack. Let me check the pot: it's 190 chips. That includes: my SB 8, BB 16, seat 5 raise 48, seat 2 raise 118? Actually seat 2 raised to 118 total, meaning they put in 118 more than the BB? Let me reconstruct: BB is 16, seat 5 raised to 48 (32 more), seat 2 raised to 118 (70 more). So seat 2's raise is to 118 total.\n\nNow I need to call 110 more (total of 118). Minimum raise to 188 (70 more). My stack is 240, so I have 232 left after posting SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). They raised in hand 62 to 283. They also bet on turn in hand 57. Not much data.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 0 chips? Actually seat 2 shows 0 chips and is marked \"out\". Maybe they're all-in? If they have 0 chips, their raise might be all-in with whatever they had left.\n\nMy hand: KJo is decent but not premium from SB. Facing a raise and a re-raise. This is likely a fold situation. Pot odds: I need to call 110 to win pot of 190 + my call 110 = 300 total? Actually current pot is 190. If I call, pot becomes 300. So I'm getting 190:110 odds = 1.73:1, need about 36% equity.\n\nKJo vs likely ranges: seat 5 raised, seat 2 re-raised. Seat 2's range is probably strong: QQ+, AK maybe. Seat 5 might have medium pairs, broadways. KJo doesn't do well against these ranges, especially out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15 BB, which is short but not desperate. Folding leaves me with 232 chips (14.5 BB). That's still playable.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot than to commit half my stack with KJo out of position against a raise and re-raise.\n\nDecision: fold.",

With my stack size, standard strategy is push/fold, and AJo is in the shoving range.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about this hand. I'm UTG with AJo, 15BB stack. Blinds are 8/16. I have 240 chips. There are 5 players at the table, but seat 2 has already folded. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the small blind, seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the big blind. I'm first to act.\n\nLooking at the opponent data for GPT-OSS-120B: They've been folding a lot preflop (7/10 times), but have raised twice: once to 283 (all-in presumably) and once to 48 (3x BB). The all-in raise was at hand #62, and the 48 raise was at hand #67. So they're fairly tight but capable of raising.\n\nMy hand AJo is decent but not premium from UTG. With a 15BB stack, this is in the push/fold range. Standard tournament strategy with 15BB: AJo from UTG is often a shove or fold decision. Let me think about the ICM implications.\n\nIf I raise, I'd be raising into 4 players left to act (SB, BB, and two others). With a 15BB stack, a standard raise commits me to the pot. If I raise to say 32-40 chips, and get re-raised, I'll be pot-committed anyway.\n\nBetter options:\n1. Fold: Conservative, preserve stack\n2. Call: Not great with AJo from UTG - invites multiway pots\n3. Raise: Standard\n4. All-in: With 15BB, this is reasonable\n\nGiven my stack size and position, I think shoving is reasonable. AJo is strong enough to shove 15BB from UTG. If I get called, I'll likely be ahead or flipping against smaller pairs.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The blinds are 8/16, so 15BB. If I shove 240, that's 15BB. The pot would be 24 (blinds) + 240 = 264, and someone would need to call 224 more (240 - 16 for BB or 240 - 8 for SB). That gives them pot odds of about 1.18:1, so they need ~46% equity. They'd need a decent hand to call.\n\nActually, let me think about the exact math. If I shove 240:\n- SB has 173 chips (10.8BB)\n- BB has 162 chips (10.1BB)\n- Others have similar stacks\n\nThey might call with a narrower range given their stack sizes.\n\nAlternative: raise to 40-48 (2.5-3x) and then fold to a shove? But with 15BB, if I raise to 48 (3x) and get shoved on, I'd have to call 192 more into a pot of... let's calculate: if SB or BB shoves over my raise, pot would be ~240+their stack+blinds. I'd be getting decent odds.\n\nActually, with 15BB, standard tournament strategy is to either shove or fold with most hands. AJo is definitely in the shoving range from UTG.\n\nLet me also consider the players behind: GPT-OSS-120B (SB) has shown some aggression but mostly folds. Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB) I don't have data on yet.\n\nI think shoving is the best play. It puts maximum pressure on the blinds and avoids playing postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 240,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AJo is a strong enough hand to shove 15BB from UTG in tournament play.

With 16.5 BB stack, I'm in push/fold territory. Typically with 15-20 BB, pocket tens is a shove from UTG. But let me check opponent tendencies first.\n\nActually, I need to make a decision. Let me think: With 16.5 BB, pocket tens is definitely a raise. Question is whether to raise standard or go all-in. Standard raise would be to 48-56 chips (3-3.5x). But then I'd have ~200 chips behind, which is awkward if someone re-raises. Shoving 264 chips might be better to avoid playing postflop OOP with a medium stack.\n\nBut let me check if there are any aggressive players behind me. The opponents are Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2, MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B. I should recall their tendencies.\n\nActually, I need to respond with JSON. I'll make a decision based on standard tournament poker: With 16.5 BB and pocket tens UTG, I should raise to ~48 chips (3x). If someone re-raises, I can consider calling if odds are good or shoving.\n\nBut actually, with this stack size, many tournament players would shove with TT UTG. Let me check typical ranges: At 15-20 BB, UTG shoving range is usually 77+, A10s+, KQs, AJo+. TT is definitely in that range.\n\nI'll raise to 48 chips (3x). That leaves me 216 behind, pot would be ~72 after my raise. If someone re-raises, I'll have to decide.\n\nActually, wait - I should use the tools first. But the system says invalid response format.

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the small blind with pocket Tens (Td Ts), stack 216 chips (13.5 BB). Preflop action: I raised to 48 (3x BB?), then Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2 with 73 chips) raised to 100, then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B with 0 chips? Actually says \"out\" meaning out of tournament? Wait, stack 0 chips but they raised 211? That seems odd. Let's parse: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). Probably eliminated but still in hand? Actually if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. Maybe they're all-in? The raise amount 211 seems huge relative to stacks. Let's think: my stack 216, Seat 4 stack 73, Seat 5 stack 0. Seat 5 raise 211 would be more than my stack. But maybe they're all-in with 211? But they have 0 chips? This is confusing.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Blinds 8/16. I'm SB, posted 8? Actually I'm seat 3 (SB). Seat 1 is UTG? Actually seat 1 is SB? Wait: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 154 chips (folded)\" but actions show \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 8\". So seat 1 posted SB? But I'm seat 3 and my position is SB. Maybe seat numbering is off? Let's read: \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". So I'm seat 3, SB. Seat 1 posted SB? That doesn't make sense. Maybe seat 1 is UTG? Actually typical 5-handed: seats: 1,2,3,4,5. I'm seat 3 SB. Seat 4 is BB? Wait: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 73 chips\" - maybe BB? But actions show \"preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 16\". So seat 2 is BB. So seat 1 is UTG? But they posted SB? Hmm.\n\nAnyway, action: I raised to 48 (from SB). Then Seat 4 raised to 100. Then Seat 5 raised to 211. Then Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold. Now action on me: amount to call: 163. Minimum raise to: 322. Legal actions: fold, call.\n\nPot is 383 chips currently. Let's calculate pot: SB 8, BB 16, my raise 48, Seat 4 raise to 100 (so added 52 more?), Seat 5 raise to 211 (added 111 more?). Actually need to compute total pot. Let's do stepwise:\n\nInitial: SB (seat 1) posts 8, BB (seat 2) posts 16. Pot = 24.\n\nI (seat 3) raise to 48. So I add 40 more (since SB already posted 8? Wait I'm SB, but seat 1 posted SB? Confusion. Actually I'm seat 3 SB, but seat 1 posted SB? Maybe seat 1 is actually SB? But description says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". Could be error. Let's assume I'm SB and I haven't posted yet? In typical poker, SB posts blind, then action. But here seat 1 posted SB, seat 2 posted BB. So maybe seat 1 is SB, seat 2 BB, I'm UTG?

They might be all-in for 73. Similarly, Seat 5 has 0 chips, so their raise to 211 is all-in for whatever they have? But they have 0 chips, maybe they're already all-in from previous hand?

Preflop action: I raised to 48 (3x BB?), then Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2 with 73 chips) raised to 100, then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B with 0 chips? Actually says \"out\" meaning out of tournament? Wait, stack 0 chips but they raised 211? That seems odd. Let's parse: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). Probably eliminated but still in hand? Actually if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. Maybe they're all-in? The raise amount 211 seems huge relative to stacks. Let's think: my stack 216, Seat 4 stack 73, Seat 5 stack 0. Seat 5 raise 211 would be more than my stack. But maybe they're all-in with 211? But they have 0 chips? This is confusing.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Blinds 8/16. I'm SB, posted 8? Actually I'm seat 3 (SB). Seat 1 is UTG? Actually seat 1 is SB? Wait: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 154 chips (folded)\" but actions show \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 8\". So seat 1 posted SB? But I'm seat 3 and my position is SB. Maybe seat numbering is off? Let's read: \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". So I'm seat 3, SB. Seat 1 posted SB? That doesn't make sense. Maybe seat 1 is UTG? Actually typical 5-handed: seats: 1,2,3,4,5. I'm seat 3 SB. Seat 4 is BB? Wait: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 73 chips\" - maybe BB? But actions show \"preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 16\". So seat 2 is BB. So seat 1 is UTG? But they posted SB? Hmm.\n\nAnyway, action: I raised to 48 (from SB). Then Seat 4 raised to 100. Then Seat 5 raised to 211. Then Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold. Now action on me: amount to call: 163. Minimum raise to: 322. Legal actions: fold, call.\n\nPot is 383 chips currently. Let's calculate pot: SB 8, BB 16, my raise 48, Seat 4 raise to 100 (so added 52 more?), Seat 5 raise to 211 (added 111 more?). Actually need to compute total pot. Let's do stepwise:\n\nInitial: SB (seat 1) posts 8, BB (seat 2) posts 16. Pot = 24.\n\nI (seat 3) raise to 48. So I add 40 more (since SB already posted 8? Wait I'm SB, but seat 1 posted SB? Confusion. Actually I'm seat 3 SB, but seat 1 posted SB? Maybe seat 1 is actually SB? But description says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". Could be error. Let's assume I'm SB and I haven't posted yet? In typical poker, SB posts blind, then action. But here seat 1 posted SB, seat 2 posted BB. So maybe seat 1 is SB, seat 2 BB, I'm UTG?

Seat 4 has only 73 chips, so they're likely all-in or nearly all-in. Seat 5 has 0 chips but raised to 211 - this is weird; maybe they're all-in from previous hand? Actually \"out\" means eliminated, so maybe they're not in the hand? But they raised... This is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should consider tournament situation: I have 13.5 BB. Pocket Tens is a strong hand. Folding would leave me with 216 chips (13.5 BB). Calling could potentially triple up or bust.\n\nLet me think about ranges:\n- Seat 4 (73 chips) raised to 100: likely strong hand, maybe pairs 88+, AJ+, maybe wider since short stack.\n- Seat 5 (0 chips) raised to 211: if they're actually all-in, they might have a very strong range (JJ+, AK).\n\nMy Tens might be behind. But pot odds are decent. However, if I call and lose, I'm down to 53 chips (3.3 BB), which is desperate. If I fold, I still have 13.5 BB, which is playable.\n\nGiven the confusion about seat positions and stacks, and the fact that I'm getting decent pot odds but risk being dominated, I should probably call. Pocket Tens is too strong to fold for 163 into 383 pot, especially with only 13.5 BB effective stack.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that Seat 4 has only 73 chips, so their effective stack is 73. Seat 5 has 0 chips? Actually if Seat 5 has 0 chips, their raise is meaningless; they can't have chips. Maybe they're all-in from antes? Not sure.\n\nLet me assume Seat 5 is all-in for some amount. The pot is 383. If I call 163, I'm all-in effectively (leaving 53 chips). Then Seat 4 calls with 73 total? They already put in 100? Wait they have 73 total, so they can't put in 100. This is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, I think the safe play is to call. Tens are strong, and I'm getting good pot odds.

That seems odd since they only have 8 chips. Let me check the action again: Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16. Seat 4 and 5 folded, Seat 1 folded. Then Seat 2 raised 166. But they only have 8 chips total. Wait, maybe the raise amount is the total they're putting in? Or maybe they're all-in? Let me think: They posted SB 8, then raised 166 total? That would mean they're putting in 166 total, but they only have 8 chips. That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at the data: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. They have 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, so they're all-in with their 8 chips. But the action says \"raise 166\". That might be a display issue. Maybe \"raise 166\" means they're raising to 166 total? But they only have 8 chips. Let me check the amount to call: 150. Minimum raise to: 316. That seems like there's already 182 in the pot. Wait, pot is 182 chips. Blinds 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. That's 24. Others folded. So pot should be 24. But pot is 182? That seems wrong. Maybe there are antes? Or maybe there's a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate: Blinds 8/16. SB posts 8, BB posts 16. That's 24. Seat 2 raised 166. If they're raising to 166 total, they're putting in 166 - 8 = 158 more. But they only have 8 chips total. So they can't raise that much. Maybe the raise amount is the additional amount? \"raise 166\" could mean they raise by 166, making total bet 174? Still doesn't make sense with 8 chips.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 is actually Kimi-K2 with 8 chips, and they're all-in for their remaining 8? But the action says \"raise 166\". Could be a bug. Let me look at the amount to call: 150. That seems huge relative to my stack of 37. I need to call 150 to win... what? Pot is 182 currently. If I call, I put in 150, making pot 332. But I only have 37 chips total. I can't call 150 because I don't have that many chips. I'm only required to call up to my stack size, right? In poker, you can only be forced to call up to your remaining stack. So if someone raises more than my stack, I can call all-in for my remaining chips.\n\nMy stack: 37 chips. I already posted BB 16, so I have 21 left. The amount to call is 150, but I only have 21. So I can call all-in for 21 more. That makes sense. So the raise is effectively putting me all-in.\n\nThus, I need to decide whether to call all-in with 4c 3d. Pot odds: I need to call 21 to win pot of 182 + 21 = 203? Let's calculate: Current pot is 182. Opponent has put in 8 (SB) + raised? Actually, they have 8 chips total, all-in. So they've put in 8. I've put in 16. Others folded. So pot should be 8+16=24. But pot is 182. That's weird. Maybe there are antes or something. Or maybe the pot includes the raise amount? Let's think: If opponent raised to 166 total, but only has 8 chips, the effective raise is 8. So the pot would be: SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's all-in 8 = 32. But pot is 182. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe the pot display includes the raise amount? Or maybe there are multiple players? Let me re-read: Players at table: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 8 chips, Seat 3 is me with 37, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 folded. So only two players active: me and Seat 2.\n\nMaybe the pot of 182 includes the raise amount of 166? That would mean the pot is 166 + 16 = 182. That makes sense: Opponent raised to 166 total, putting in 166. But they only have 8 chips. So maybe"

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. My hand is 4c 3d, extremely weak. I'm in BB with 37 chips (2.3 BB). Opponent in SB has only 8 chips total. They raised to 166, which is more than their stack, so they're effectively all-in for their 8 chips. The amount to call is 150, but I only have 21 chips left after posting BB. So I can call all-in for 21 more chips.\n\nPot calculation: SB posted 8, I posted 16. Opponent is all-in for 8 total, so they've put in 8. I've put in 16. Pot should be 24. But pot shows 182. That suggests maybe there are antes or the pot includes the raise amount incorrectly. Regardless, I'm getting pot odds: I need to call 21 to win whatever is in the pot. If pot is truly 182, then I'm getting 182:21 odds, which is about 8.7:1. That's huge. But 4c 3d is a terrible hand, only 23% equity against a random hand. Actually, 43o has about 38% equity against a random hand? Let me think: 43o vs random has around 38% equity preflop. Against a typical raising range from SB, maybe 25-30%. But opponent only has 8 chips and is desperate, so their range could be very wide.\n\nLooking at opponent history: In hand 67, they raised to 118 preflop. They seem aggressive when they have chips. Now they have only 8 chips, so they're likely shoving with any two cards. My 43o has decent equity against a random hand - about 38%. With pot odds of 8.7:1, I only need about 10% equity to call. 38% is way above that.\n\nBut wait, there's something odd about the pot size. Let me check hand 67 from opponent history: they raised to 118. That was when they had more chips. Now they have 8 chips. The pot size of 182 seems wrong for just SB vs BB. Maybe the display includes the raise amount in the pot? If opponent raised to 166, and I've put in 16, pot would be 166+16=182. But opponent only has 8 chips, so they can't raise to 166. Unless... maybe the \"raise 166\" means they're raising all-in, and 166 is the total pot size? No.\n\nActually, looking at the data: \"Amount to call: 150\" and \"Minimum raise to: 316\". If opponent raised to 166 total, then the amount to call would be 166 - 16 = 150. That makes sense. Minimum raise would be to 166 + 150 = 316. So opponent raised to 166 total. But they only have 8 chips. This is contradictory. Unless the stack display is wrong, or opponent actually has more chips than shown.\n\nLet me think about tournament situation: I have 37 chips (2.3 BB). That's critically short. Opponent has 8 chips (0.5 BB). We're both very short. In tournament poker, when both players are this short, you should call with a very wide range because you're getting good pot odds and need to accumulate chips. With 2.3 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. Here, opponent has shoved (effectively). I need to decide whether to call.\n\nWith 43o, it's a marginal hand. But against a desperate opponent with 0.5 BB, they could be shoving any two cards. My equity against any two cards is about 38%. Pot odds: I need to call 21 to win pot. Let's calculate actual pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's all-in 8 = 32. If I call 21 more, total pot becomes 53. I'm investing 21 to win 32, so pot odds are 32:21 or 1.52:1. I need 39.7% equity to break even. 43o has about 38% against random hand. So it's close to break-even.\n\nBut if the pot is actually larger (182 as shown), then odds are much better. Given the display inconsistency, I should assume the actual pot is smaller. However, in tournament with both players very short, I should probably call. Folding leaves me with 21 chips (1.3 BB). Calling and winning gives me 37+8=45 chips (2.8 BB). Calling and losing eliminates me.\n\nGiven my equity and the situation, it's a close decision. But with such short stacks, I should take the gamble. The opponent is desperate and likely shoving wide. My hand has some potential to"

That seems odd since they only have 8 chips. Let me check the action again: Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16. Seat 4 and 5 folded, Seat 1 folded. Then Seat 2 raised 166. But they only have 8 chips total. Wait, maybe the raise amount is the total they're putting in? Or maybe they're all-in? Let me think: They posted SB 8, then raised 166 total? That would mean they're putting in 166 total, but they only have 8 chips. That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at the data: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. They have 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, so they're all-in with their 8 chips. But the action says \"raise 166\". That might be a display issue. Maybe \"raise 166\" means they're raising to 166 total? But they only have 8 chips. Let me check the amount to call: 150. Minimum raise to: 316. That seems like there's already 182 in the pot. Wait, pot is 182 chips. Blinds 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. That's 24. Others folded. So pot should be 24. But pot is 182? That seems wrong. Maybe there are antes? Or maybe there's a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate: Blinds 8/16. SB posts 8, BB posts 16. That's 24. Seat 2 raised 166. If they're raising to 166 total, they're putting in 166 - 8 = 158 more. But they only have 8 chips total. So they can't raise that much. Maybe the raise amount is the additional amount? \"raise 166\" could mean they raise by 166, making total bet 174? Still doesn't make sense with 8 chips.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 is actually Kimi-K2 with 8 chips, and they're all-in for their remaining 8? But the action says \"raise 166\". Could be a bug. Let me look at the amount to call: 150. That seems huge relative to my stack of 37. I need to call 150 to win... what? Pot is 182 currently. If I call, I put in 150, making pot 332. But I only have 37 chips total. I can't call 150 because I don't have that many chips. I'm only required to call up to my stack size, right? In poker, you can only be forced to call up to your remaining stack. So if someone raises more than my stack, I can call all-in for my remaining chips.\n\nMy stack: 37 chips. I already posted BB 16, so I have 21 left. The amount to call is 150, but I only have 21. So I can call all-in for 21 more. That makes sense. So the raise is effectively putting me all-in.\n\nThus, I need to decide whether to call all-in with 4c 3d. Pot odds: I need to call 21 to win pot of 182 + 21 = 203? Let's calculate: Current pot is 182. Opponent has put in 8 (SB) + raised? Actually, they have 8 chips total, all-in. So they've put in 8. I've put in 16. Others folded. So pot should be 8+16=24. But pot is 182. That's weird. Maybe there are antes or something. Or maybe the pot includes the raise amount? Let's think: If opponent raised to 166 total, but only has 8 chips, the effective raise is 8. So the pot would be: SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's all-in 8 = 32. But pot is 182. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe the pot display includes the raise amount? Or maybe there are multiple players?

Let me think about the opponents. Seat 2 just called, which suggests weakness - they didn't raise. They might have a marginal hand.

Let's see: Board 7-3-5-K, I have A-9. I need 6 for 3-4-5-6-7 straight (but I have A-9, not 4). Actually 6 gives 3-4-5-6-7 straight but I don't have 4. T gives 5-6-7-8-9? No. Actually not many straight draws.\n- Basically just ace-high on K-high board\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 2 to win 10 (8+2) = 20% pot odds\n- Need ~20% equity to call\n\n**Equity Estimate:**\n- Against a king: ~5% equity (ace-high vs Kx)\n- Against a pair like 7x, 5x, 3x: ~15-20% equity (6 outs to pair ace)\n- Against a draw: maybe 30-40% equity\n- Against complete bluff: ~60%+ equity\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\n- Small 25% pot bet on turn after checking flop\n- Could be probing bet with weak hand\n- Could be value bet with weak king or pair\n- Could be draw (flush draw with Ks on board)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- 98 BB stack - can afford speculative calls\n- Position advantage on river\n- Small investment (2 chips = 1% of stack)\n\n**Decision:**\nCall seems reasonable. Small price to see river, maintain position, and potentially bluff if checked to on river. Fold would be tight but not terrible given weak hand. Raise seems bad with no real hand strength.\n\nI'll call.",

          "content": "I'm at the river with Ac 9d. Board is 7d 3d 5s Ks 4d. Pot is 10 chips. I'm on the button, opponent (MiniMax-M2) is in the big blind. I called a small bet of 2 on the turn. Now the river completed a possible flush with 4d, making board 7d 3d 5s Ks 4d. I have Ac 9d - I have Ace high with the 9d, but no pair. The board shows three diamonds: 7d, 3d, 4d. I have the 9d, so I have a diamond flush? Wait: I have Ac 9d. Ac is Ace of clubs, not diamonds. 9d is 9 of diamonds. So I have one diamond (9d). Board has three diamonds: 7d, 3d, 4d. That's four diamonds total. I have a flush! Yes, I have a diamond flush with Ace high? Actually Ace is clubs, so my highest diamond is 9. So I have a 9-high flush. Board has 7d, 3d, 4d, plus Ks and 5s. So my flush is 9-high. Could there be a higher flush? Someone could have a diamond higher than 9, like Td, Jd, Qd, Kd, Ad. Ad would be the nut flush. Kd would be king-high flush. But Kd is not on board. So possible higher flushes exist. However, opponent's betting pattern: they checked flop, bet small on turn (2 into pot of 6? Let's reconstruct: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, Seat 2 called 2, I called 1 (SB to BB), BB checked. Pot preflop: 1+2+2+1=6? Actually SB 1, BB 2, caller 2, I call additional 1 (total 2). So pot preflop: 1+2+2+1=6. Flop checked around. Turn: I check, BB bets 2, Seat 2 folds, I call 2. Pot after turn: 6+2+2=10. River brings 4d, completing flush draw. I have flush. Opponent could have been betting a draw on turn, maybe a diamond draw, or a pair. They bet small, 2 into 6, which is a small bet. Could be a probe bet with a weak pair or a draw. Now river completes flush. I should consider betting for value. But I'm out of position? Actually I'm on button, but action order: I'm first to act on river because BB acted last on previous streets? Let's see: On turn, I checked, BB bet, I called. On river, action starts with me (button) because BB acted last on turn? Actually in Texas Hold'em, the player to the left of the button acts first on each street. The button is last to act. I'm seat 3 (button). Seat 4 is BB (to my left). So on flop and turn, seat 4 acted after me. On river, I act first because I'm button? Wait: The button acts last postflop. So after the turn, the button (me) acts last. But the hand history says: turn: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call. So on turn, I checked, then BB bet, then I called. That means I checked first because I was first to act? Actually preflop: SB (seat 3) acted first, then BB, then UTG, etc. Postflop: the player to the left of the button acts first. That's seat 4 (BB). But the hand history shows seat 3 check first on flop and turn. That suggests seat 3 is first to act? Maybe because seat 2 folded? Let's check players: Seat 1 folded preflop, Seat 2 called preflop, Seat 3 (me) SB, Seat 4 BB, Seat 5 folded. After flop, remaining players: Seat 2, Seat 3, Seat 4. The order: Seat 2 is UTG? Actually positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Not sure. But typical order: button is seat 3, SB is seat 3? Actually SB is seat 3, BB is seat 4.

          "reasoning_content": "I'm at the river with Ac 9d. Board is 7d 3d 5s Ks 4d. Pot is 10 chips. I'm on the button, opponent (MiniMax-M2) is in the big blind. I called a small bet of 2 on the turn. Now the river completed a possible flush with 4d, making board 7d 3d 5s Ks 4d. I have Ac 9d - I have Ace high with the 9d, but no pair. The board shows three diamonds: 7d, 3d, 4d. I have the 9d, so I have a diamond flush? Wait: I have Ac 9d. Ac is Ace of clubs, not diamonds. 9d is 9 of diamonds. So I have one diamond (9d). Board has three diamonds: 7d, 3d, 4d. That's four diamonds total. I have a flush! Yes, I have a diamond flush with Ace high? Actually Ace is clubs, so my highest diamond is 9. So I have a 9-high flush. Board has 7d, 3d, 4d, plus Ks and 5s. So my flush is 9-high. Could there be a higher flush? Someone could have a diamond higher than 9, like Td, Jd, Qd, Kd, Ad. Ad would be the nut flush. Kd would be king-high flush. But Kd is not on board. So possible higher flushes exist. However, opponent's betting pattern: they checked flop, bet small on turn (2 into pot of 6? Let's reconstruct: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, Seat 2 called 2, I called 1 (SB to BB), BB checked. Pot preflop: 1+2+2+1=6? Actually SB 1, BB 2, caller 2, I call additional 1 (total 2). So pot preflop: 1+2+2+1=6. Flop checked around. Turn: I check, BB bets 2, Seat 2 folds, I call 2. Pot after turn: 6+2+2=10. River brings 4d, completing flush draw. I have flush. Opponent could have been betting a draw on turn, maybe a diamond draw, or a pair. They bet small, 2 into 6, which is a small bet. Could be a probe bet with a weak pair or a draw. Now river completes flush. I should consider betting for value. But I'm out of position? Actually I'm on button, but action order: I'm first to act on river because BB acted last on previous streets? Let's see: On turn, I checked, BB bet, I called. On river, action starts with me (button) because BB acted last on turn? Actually in Texas Hold'em, the player to the left of the button acts first on each street. The button is last to act. I'm seat 3 (button). Seat 4 is BB (to my left). So on flop and turn, seat 4 acted after me. On river, I act first because I'm button? Wait: The button acts last postflop. So after the turn, the button (me) acts last. But the hand history says: turn: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call. So on turn, I checked, then BB bet, then I called. That means I checked first because I was first to act? Actually preflop: SB (seat 3) acted first, then BB, then UTG, etc. Postflop: the player to the left of the button acts first. That's seat 4 (BB). But the hand history shows seat 3 check first on flop and turn. That suggests seat 3 is first to act? Maybe because seat 2 folded? Let's check players: Seat 1 folded preflop, Seat 2 called preflop, Seat 3 (me) SB, Seat 4 BB, Seat 5 folded. After flop, remaining players: Seat 2, Seat 3, Seat 4. The order: Seat 2 is UTG? Actually positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Not sure. But typical order: button is seat 3, SB is seat 3? Actually SB is seat 3, BB is seat 4. So postflop, first to act is seat 2 (UTG), then seat 3 (button/SB), then seat 4 (BB). But hand history says: flop: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 check, Seat 2 check. That suggests",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, and reasoning. I'm on the river with a flush. The pot is 10 chips. I have first action (or maybe not? Let me re-examine: The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet facing me. So I can check or bet. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. So I can check or raise (bet). I have a 9-high flush. Board: 7d 3d 5s Ks 4d. My hand: Ac 9d. I have a flush with 9-high. Possible better flushes: any diamond higher than 9: Td, Jd, Qd, Kd, Ad. Ad is nut flush. Kd is king-high flush. But opponent's betting pattern: they checked flop, bet small on turn (2 into 6). Could be a probe bet with a pair like Kx, or a draw like diamond draw. If they had a diamond draw, they might have bet turn as a semi-bluff. Now river completes flush. If they had a diamond draw, they might have a higher flush if they held a higher diamond. But they might also have a pair and now be scared of flush. I should consider betting for value against weaker hands like one pair, two pair, or smaller flush. But bet sizing? Pot is 10. I could bet small like 4-5 chips, or check to induce a bluff. However, I'm out of position? Actually I'm button, but action starts with me? The prompt doesn't specify order, but \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's my turn to act and there's no bet. So I'm first to act. I could check to induce a bluff from opponent if they have a weak hand, or bet for value. Given the small pot and my medium-strength flush, I think checking might be reasonable to keep pot small and avoid getting raised by a better flush. But I have a flush, which is strong. However, it's only 9-high. There are many better flushes possible. But opponent's range: they're BB, checked preflop, checked flop, bet small on turn. Their range could be wide: any two cards. They could have a king (top pair), a straight draw (6x for open-ended?), a flush draw, or nothing. On river, if they have a weak pair, they might check back. If they have a flush, they might bet. If they have a busted draw, they might bluff. I think betting small for value is good: maybe 5 chips (half pot). If they raise, I can fold. But they might call with worse hands like one pair or two pair. Let me think about stack sizes: I have 194 chips (97 BB). Opponent has 263 chips. Pot is 10. A bet of 5 is reasonable. I'll bet 5. But need to use raise_to as total amount. If I bet 5, that's a raise to 5? Actually \"raise_to\" is total amount I'm putting in. Since amount to call is 0, if I bet 5, I'm raising to 5? The interface might consider a bet as a raise. Legal actions include raise. So I can raise to 5. Minimum raise to is 2. So I can raise to any amount >=2. I'll raise to 5. Let's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand:** Q\u2665 8\u2665  \n**Position:** BTN (Button)  \n**Stack:** 202 chips (101 BB)  \n**Board:** K\u2660 7\u2665 7\u2660 6\u2666  \n**Pot:** 5 chips  \n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) with 166 chips  \n**Action:** Opponent checked to me on the turn, amount to call is 0\n\nMy hand: Q\u2665 8\u2665 - This is a weak hand on this board. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for a straight: 9-7-6-? Actually board is K-7-7-6, so I need a 9 to make 9-8-7-6, but that's not a straight... wait, let me think: Board is Ks 7h 7s 6d. I have Q8. I need 9-10 for a straight? Actually, for a straight I'd need 9-10, but that's two cards. Or I could pair my Q or 8. I have a backdoor flush draw with hearts (7\u2665 on board, I have Q\u26658\u2665, so two hearts). But only one heart on board, so not really a flush draw.\n\nActually, I have a gutshot straight draw to a 9 (9-8-7-6) - that's 4 outs. Also could pair my Q or 8 (6 outs total). So maybe 10 outs total, but some might be dirty.\n\nOpponent: GPT-OSS-120B has shown some passive play in previous hands. In hand #1, they called multiple bets preflop, then called on flop, folded on turn. In hand #2, they folded preflop.\n\nThe pot is only 5 chips. I'm on the button. My hand is weak but I have position. I could try to bluff or semi-bluff with my draws.\n\nGiven the small pot and my weak hand, checking seems reasonable. But I have position advantage and could try to take the pot down with a bet. However, the board is paired (7s) which reduces the likelihood opponent has a strong hand that would call. They might have a K, a 7, or a draw.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing: Minimum raise is 2 chips (total). Pot is 5, so a bet of 2-3 chips would be small. If I bet, I'm representing a K or a 7. But with Q8, I'm basically bluffing.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 101 BB, opponent has 83 BB. Not deep stacked but not short either. Risking a small amount to win 5 chips might be okay.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: I have position and the pot is tiny. Checking might be fine to see a free river card. But if I bet small (2 chips), I might get a fold from hands like small pairs, A-high, etc. And if called, I still have some outs on river.\n\nI'll check and see a free river. No need to bluff into such a small pot when I have position and can evaluate river.",

The board shows a pair of 7s on the flop, and I hit my queen on the river. My opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) checked to me on the river after checking through the flop and turn.\n\nLooking at the search results for GPT-OSS-120B: In hand #1, they folded to a turn bet with A5s on a 5c6d2s7d board. In hand #2, they folded preflop from the SB with Ac9d. So they seem somewhat cautious.\n\nThe pot is only 5 chips. I have top pair with queen, but my kicker is weak (8). However, the board has a pair of 7s, so there's a possibility of trips or a full house, but unlikely given the action. My opponent checked three streets, so they likely have a weak hand.\n\nGiven that I'm in position and my opponent has shown weakness by checking all streets, I should value bet my pair of queens. The pot is small, so I should make a small bet to get value from worse hands like weaker queens, 8s, or maybe even a bluff catcher.\n\nI have 202 chips (101 BB), so a small bet of 4-6 chips (2-3 BB) seems reasonable. I'll go with 5 chips, which is pot-sized. This should get called by worse hands but fold out better ones.\n\nLet me check: amount to call is 0, minimum raise to is 2. So I can raise to any amount from 2 up to my stack. I'll raise to 7 (putting in 5 more chips). Actually, wait - if I raise, I need to specify the total amount. Currently I have 0 in the pot (I called preflop 2). So if I want to bet 5 chips, I need to raise to 7 total (2 already in + 5 more).\n\nBut actually, I should check the action: I called preflop 2, then checked flop and turn. So I have 2 chips already invested. To bet 5 chips, I need to put in 5 more, making total 7. Yes.\n\nI think a bet of 5 chips (half pot) is good. Let me do that.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 5s. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 total (so 4 more for me to call). The pot is 8 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 5 raise). I have 205 chips (102.5 BB). Looking at opponent history: Seat 2 has mostly folded preflop (folded 4 out of 5 hands, called once). This is their first raise. They raised from SB after 3 folds, so they could be raising light from the small blind.\n\nPocket 5s is a medium pocket pair. In the BB facing a SB raise, I have good pot odds: need to call 4 to win 8, so 2:1 odds. That's 33% equity needed. Against a typical SB raising range, 55 has about 55-60% equity. So calling is profitable. However, I should consider raising for value or to take initiative. But pocket 5s is vulnerable to overcards on flop. Given opponent's tight history (mostly folding), their raise might be stronger than typical SB range.\n\nBut I have position advantage (BB vs SB) - I'll act last postflop. With 102.5 BB deep, implied odds are good if I hit a set (7.5:1 odds to flop a set, need ~12:1 implied odds). The raise is small (3x BB), so I'm getting good direct odds too.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to fold preflop, they might be raising with a decent hand but could fold to a 3-bet. However, 55 is not a great 3-bet bluff hand since it has decent showdown value. I think calling is best - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set, and if I miss, can fold to aggression.\n\nLet me check: legal actions are fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 10 (total). I could raise to 10-15, but with 55 and opponent's tightness, they might call or 4-bet with better hands. Calling seems optimal.\n\nDecision: Call. Reason: Good pot odds (2:1), pocket pair has decent equity against SB raising range, position advantage, good implied odds if we hit a set, and opponent has shown tight tendencies suggesting their raise may be stronger than typical SB range, making 3-bet risky.",

However, the system is telling me I'm not responding in the correct format. Let me think about this hand first without the tools.\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 5s. The board is Ks 7h 3s. I have a small pocket pair that didn't hit a set. The opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised preflop from SB and now bets 8 into a 20 pot on the flop. That's a 40% pot bet.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s - I have middle pair but it's a weak pair on this board. The board has a K, which is likely to hit a preflop raiser's range. There are also two spades, so there's a flush draw possibility.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 28 (20 pot + 8 bet). That's about 3.5:1 odds, or 22% equity needed. My pair of 5s might have some equity against his range, but I'm likely behind to any K, any pair higher than 5s, or overcards with spades.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nStack sizes: I have 201 chips, opponent has 181. The bet is small relative to stacks.\n\nWithout opponent history, I need to make a standard decision. This is a weak hand on this board. I'm likely behind and drawing thin. Folding seems reasonable. Calling might keep me in the hand but I'm out of position and could face more pressure on later streets.\n\nLet me check if there are any draws I could represent. The board has a flush draw, but I don't have spades. I could potentially raise as a bluff, but with my small pair, that's risky.\n\nGiven the pot odds and my weak hand, I think folding is correct.

The pot is currently: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 = 9? Wait, SB 1, BB 2, raise 6 = total 9. Actually, Seat 2 raised to 6 total, which includes the call of BB 2? Let's think: Blinds 1/2. SB posts 1, BB posts 2. Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 folds. Seat 2 raises to 6 total. That means they put in 6 chips total, which is a raise of 4 over the BB (since BB is 2). So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 = 9 chips. I need to call 5 more (since I already put in 1 as SB). My stack after posting SB is 199? Actually I started with 200, posted SB 1, so I have 199 left. To call 5, I'd have 194 left.\n\nThis is a marginal hand: J5 suited. Not strong. However, I'm in the SB, so I get to act last postflop if I call? Actually, after the flop, the betting order is SB first (since BB is the only other player?). Wait, there's BB (Seat 4) still to act after Seat 2's raise. So there's BB left to act. If I call, then BB can call, raise, or fold. If BB calls, then three players see flop: SB (me), BB, and Seat 2. Postflop, the order is SB first (since SB is left of BB? Actually, the order postflop is the first active player left of the button. The button is Seat 5? Wait, no button indicated. Typically button is Seat 5? The positions: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 UTG+1, Seat 3 SB, Seat 4 BB, Seat 5 Button? Actually, in 5-handed, positions: Seat 5 is button, Seat 1 SB, Seat 2 BB, Seat 3 UTG, Seat 4 UTG+1? But the hand says: Seat 3 is SB, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is folded. So button must be Seat 5 (since SB is Seat 3, BB is Seat 4). So postflop, the first to act is the player left of the button, which is Seat 1 (folded), then Seat 2, then Seat 3 (me), then Seat 4. But since Seat 1 folded, the first to act is Seat 2 (UTG+1). Actually, need to confirm: In typical 5-handed, button is Seat 5, SB is Seat 1, BB is Seat 2, UTG is Seat 3, UTG+1 is Seat 4. But here they list Seat 3 as SB, Seat 4 as BB, Seat 5 folded. So maybe the table is 5-handed but positions are different. Anyway, I'll assume postflop I'll act after the raiser (Seat 2) if BB folds. If BB calls, I'll act first? Actually, if BB calls, there will be three players: SB (me), BB, and Seat 2. The order postflop is first active player left of the button. Button is Seat 5 (folded). So first active left of button is Seat 1 (folded), then Seat 2, then Seat 3 (me), then Seat 4. So Seat 2 acts first, then me, then BB. That's good: I get to see what Seat 2 does before I act.\n\nNow, hand strength: J5 suited is not great, but suited connectors can have implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. However, J5 suited is a gap of 3, not a connector. It's a weak suited hand. In the SB facing a raise, usually fold. But let's consider stack sizes: I have 100 BB, opponent has 195 (97.5 BB). The raise is to 6 (3 BB). Pot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9 (current pot) + 5 (my call) + maybe BB call? Actually, if I call, pot becomes 14 (9+5). Then BB can call 4 more (since BB already put 2, needs to call 4 more). If BB calls, pot becomes 18. My investment is 5. Pot odds: 5 to win 9 currently,"

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more context. Looking at opponent actions: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop in hand #6 to 6 as well, then bet 8 on flop. That suggests they're capable of raising preflop and following through. In hand #2, they called preflop, checked flop, folded turn. In other hands, they folded preflop. So they seem somewhat tight but will raise with decent hands.\n\nMy hand: J5 suited is weak. In the SB, facing a raise from UTG+1, I should generally fold. However, let's consider pot odds: I need to call 5 to win current pot of 9. That's pot odds of 5:9, or 1:1.8, meaning I need about 35.7% equity. J5s vs a reasonable raising range (say top 20%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo) has about 30% equity. So not quite enough. Plus implied odds: if I hit a flush or straight, I could win more, but J5s is a weak suited hand - the flush is low, and straight potential is limited. Also, I'm out of position postflop (I'll act after the raiser but before BB if BB calls). Actually, if BB calls, there will be three players: Seat 2 acts first, then me, then BB. So I'm in middle position, which is okay.\n\nBut overall, this is a fold. The hand is too weak, and calling 5 (2.5 BB) with J5s from SB facing a raise is not profitable. Better to preserve my stack. I have 100 BB, no need to play marginal hands from out of position.\n\nLet's also consider tournament implications: early in tournament, I should play tight, especially from SB with weak hands. Folding is correct.\n\nThus, I'll fold.",

I can fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at the opponent history: Seat 2 has raised preflop twice in recent hands (hand #6 and hand #7). In hand #6 they raised to 6, then bet 8 on flop. In hand #7 they raised to 6. They've folded 5 times preflop, called once. So they're not super aggressive but have shown some raising activity.\n\nMy hand: 6d4d is a suited connector, but a weak one (6-4 suited). On the button, I have position advantage, which is valuable. However, this is a very weak hand. Suited connectors need good implied odds to play, and calling 6 chips (3BB) with a hand that needs to hit a flop hard is questionable.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 9 chips (1SB + 2BB + 6 raise). I need to call 6 to win 9, so pot odds are 6:9 or 1:1.5 (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have 40% equity against a typical raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 100BB stack, healthy. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nPosition helps, but the hand is just too weak. Even with position, 64s is a bottom-tier suited connector. Better to fold and wait for better spots.\n\nLet me also check if there are any other players to act after me: Seat 4 (SB) and Seat 5 (BB) still to act. They could reraise, making my call even worse.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised to 6 chips (3x BB). From the recall data, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop to 6 chips in the last 3 hands (hands 6, 7, 8). This suggests they might be raising frequently or have a wide opening range.\n\nHowever, my hand is very weak. J2 offsuit doesn't play well against a raise. I'm out of position (SB) which makes playing this hand even worse. I would need to call 5 chips into a pot that will be 9 + 5 = 14 chips if I call, giving me pot odds of about 5:14 or 1:2.8.\n\nBut the real issue is implied odds - with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to hit a flop that gives me a strong hand. Even if I hit a J, I could be dominated by better jacks. The 2 is almost useless.\n\nAlso, I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands from out of position.\n\nThe BB (Seat 4) is still to act behind me, so there's additional risk of a squeeze.\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's frequent raising, they might be stealing, but J2 is still too weak to defend with from the SB. I should fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J2o is a very weak hand from SB out of position.

However, Q3s is borderline for this.\n\nMy stack: 200 chips (100 BB) - healthy stack.\nPosition: Button is the best position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 3 chips (1.5:1 odds). That's good pot odds, but the hand quality matters.\n\nIf I raise, I could potentially steal the blinds given opponent tendencies. If I call, I'm playing a weak hand out of position against the blinds who could check or bet.\n\nLet me think about tournament strategy: I have a healthy stack, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks. But I also want to accumulate chips. The button is a good spot to apply pressure.\n\nGiven the extreme tightness of GPT-OSS-120B (BB folding 9 straight hands) and MiniMax-M2's recent folding streak, a raise might be profitable. However, Q3s is really weak - if called, I'll often be dominated.\n\nBetter to fold this marginal hand and wait for better spots. The pot is small, and I have position on future hands.\n\nWait, actually I should check if there are any antes. No antes mentioned, just blinds 1/2.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Q3s is too weak even on the button against two opponents, even if they're tight. I'd rather wait for a better hand to attack their blinds.\n\nLet me respond.",

I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise from the button position.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2. I'm on the button, which is the best position. With Q3 suited, it's a speculative hand - suited connectors have good implied odds but Q3 is not a great suited hand.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the small blind with 233 chips, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the big blind with 163 chips. I need to recall how these opponents play from the blinds when facing a button raise.\n\nSince I can't use tools due to format issues, I'll rely on general poker strategy. From the button with Q3s, standard play would be to raise to steal the blinds, especially since everyone has folded to me. However, Q3s is quite weak - even suited, it's not a great hand. The suited aspect gives some postflop potential.\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 2 to see the flop. If I raise, minimum raise to is 4 (total). \n\nConsidering stack sizes: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is healthy. The blinds have 233 and 163 chips respectively. A small raise to 4-6 chips (2-3x BB) could work as a steal attempt.\n\nHowever, Q3s is really weak. Even from the button, this hand has limited postflop playability. The suited aspect helps, but Q3 will often be dominated by better queens or make weak pairs.\n\nGiven the deep stacks (100 BB), I might prefer to either fold or make a small raise. Calling from the button with Q3s is not great because I'll be out of position against the blinds postflop if they call.\n\nI think the best play is to make a small raise to try to steal the blinds. If called, I have position and can potentially bluff or make a hand. Q3s has some flush potential.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips total (a 3x raise from the BB). This is a standard button raise size.",

But folded preflop last 3 hands. Called my preflop raise this hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded preflop a lot (7 of last 10 actions). Called my preflop raise this hand.\n\n**My preflop action:**\n- I raised to 6 (3x BB) from BTN with Q3s. This is a standard button steal attempt.\n- Both blinds called.\n\n**Flop action:**\n- Board: K\u2663 T\u2666 5\u2665\n- Both checked to me, I checked behind. This was reasonable with just a backdoor flush draw and weak hand.\n\n**Turn action:**\n- Turn: 9\u2666 giving me a flush draw\n- Both opponents checked to me again\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a flush draw with 9 outs (~18% chance to hit on river)\n2. Pot is 18 chips, I could bet for value/protection\n3. Position advantage - I get to see river action first\n4. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking twice\n5. My image: I raised preflop from BTN, could represent a strong hand\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see river. Safe but gives up potential fold equity.\n2. **Bet**: Semi-bluff with flush draw. Could get folds from weak hands. If called, I still have outs.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Both opponents seem weak (checked twice)\n- Pot is small (18 chips)\n- I have position\n- A bet of 10-12 chips (about 2/3 pot) could work well\n- If I get called, I still have good equity with flush draw\n- If I get raised, I can fold (though unlikely given their passivity)\n\nI think a semi-bluff bet makes sense here.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation. I'm on the button with Qd 3d, board is Kc Td 5h 9d 3h. I have a pair of threes with queen kicker. The board shows Kc Td 5h 9d 3h. I have Qd 3d, so I have a pair of threes, queen kicker. No flush possible for me (I have diamonds but board has only 2 diamonds). Opponent checked to me on river.\n\nPot is 42 chips. I bet 12 on turn, opponent called. Now they check river. I need to decide whether to bet again or check behind.\n\nLet me think about hand strength: I have bottom pair with weak kicker. Board has K, T, 9, 5, 3. What could opponent have? They called preflop from SB after my raise, then called my turn bet. They could have draws that missed, weak kings, maybe middle pair, maybe a flush draw that didn't come in (only 2 diamonds on board). The river brought a 3h, giving me trips actually - wait no, I have Qd 3d, board has 3h, so I have two pair: threes and... actually I have a pair of threes, not two pair. Board has 3h, I have 3d, so I have trips! Actually yes: I have pocket 3, board has 3, so I have three of a kind! That's strong.\n\nWait: I have Qd 3d. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d 3h. So I have a pair of threes, but board has a 3, so that makes three of a kind! Yes, I have trips: 3d + 3h on board. So I have trips threes. That's a strong hand. What beats me? Higher trips (K, T, 9, 5 trips), straights (QJ would make straight, but board is K T 9 5 3, so QJ would be KQJT9 - that's a straight! Actually QJ would make a straight: K Q J T 9. Yes, QJ makes a straight. Also J8 makes straight: T 9 8 5 3? No, J8 would need 7. Actually J8 doesn't make straight. Let's check: Board K T 9 5 3. Straights possible: QJ makes KQJT9. Also 87 makes T9875? No. 76 makes 98765? No 6 on board. So only QJ makes a straight. Also two pair or flush not possible.\n\nSo I have trips threes. That's likely the best hand unless opponent has QJ for straight or higher trips (KK, TT, 99, 55). But those are less likely given preflop action. Opponent called from SB after my raise, so they could have suited connectors, small pairs, etc.\n\nThey called turn bet on 9d turn. Now river is 3h, giving me trips. They check. Should I bet for value? Probably yes, as trips are strong. But need to consider if they'll call with worse. They might have a king, maybe T9, maybe pair of tens or nines. They might call a small bet.\n\nBut also need to consider my image: I raised preflop from BTN, checked flop, bet turn. Could be seen as continuation bet. Now river improves me. I should bet for value.\n\nHowever, need to recall opponent tendencies. Let me use tools to see opponent's behavior. First, who is opponent? Seat 4: MiniMax-M2. Let me recall their actions.",

I have bottom pair with a queen kicker, and a flush draw that missed (diamond draw didn't come in). The river brought the 3h, giving me a pair of threes.\n\nOpponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) checked on the river. I need to decide whether to check or bet/raise. Let me think:\n\n1. Hand strength: I have bottom pair (3s) with Q kicker. This is a weak hand on this board. The board has K, T, 9, 5, 3. There are straight possibilities (QJ would make a straight, J8 would make a straight). My hand is likely only beating bluffs or worse pairs.\n\n2. Opponent behavior: MiniMax-M2 called my turn bet of 12 after checking twice (flop and turn). They called from the small blind position. Their range could include: Kx hands, Tx hands, 9x hands, flush draws, straight draws, or maybe even slow-played strong hands.\n\n3. Pot odds: Pot is 42 chips. If I bet, I need to consider what worse hands might call. Given my weak hand, value betting seems questionable.\n\n4. Tournament considerations: I have 182 chips (91 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n5. Opponent history: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 seems to be somewhat active - betting on flop in hand 8, calling and betting in hand 9. They folded preflop in last few hands. Their turn call suggests they have something.\n\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand, checking back seems prudent. I could consider a small bluff, but with bottom pair and no draw, it's risky. The opponent called my turn bet, so they likely have at least a piece of the board. A river bet might get called by better hands and fold out worse hands.\n\nBetter to check and see what they have, preserving my stack. Let me check.",

Tournament considerations: No need to take unnecessary risks with such a deep stack\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3, but that's not good enough for such a weak hand\n\nStandard play here is definitely to fold. Even if I were in later position, K2o is a fold. From UTG, it's an easy fold.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to play this hand. Maybe if opponents are very tight or passive? But without specific information, folding is correct.\n\nI should respond with the JSON format. Action: fold, raise_to: null, reasoning: brief explanation.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format, but first I should think about the situation. I'm in the BB with 5d 6c. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 6 total (so 4 more to call). I have 222 chips (111 BB). The pot is 9 chips. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nFirst, let me consider my hand: 5d 6c is a suited connector, but it's offsuit here. It's a speculative hand that plays well in multiway pots, but this is heads-up against a raiser. In the BB, I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 9, which is 2.25:1 odds, or about 31% equity needed. Against a typical raising range from UTG (Seat 1 is UTG?), actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let me check: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is BB (me), Seat 4 is UTG? Wait, the positions: Seat 1 is first to act preflop? Actually, with 5 players: Seat 1 is UTG, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is BB, Seat 4 is Button? Actually, the table order: Seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Seat 4 and 5 folded. So Seat 1 is UTG, raised. So it's a UTG raise.\n\nUTG raising range is typically tight: maybe top 15-20% of hands. 56o has about 30% equity against a top 15% range. Actually, let me estimate: 56o vs top 15% (22+, A2s+, K9s+, QTs+, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s, 65s, AJo+, KQo) has about 32% equity. So I have roughly the required equity based on pot odds alone.\n\nBut there are other factors: position disadvantage (I'll be out of position postflop), stack sizes (I have 111 BB, opponent has 205 chips = 102.5 BB). Implied odds: if I hit a strong hand (two pair, straight, etc.), I can win more chips. Reverse implied odds: if I hit a marginal hand like a pair of 5s or 6s, I could lose a lot.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (111 BB), so I can afford to take a speculative call. However, being out of position with a weak hand is not ideal.\n\nI should also consider opponent tendencies. Let me try to recall opponent actions, but the tool calls are failing. I need to respond in JSON format. Maybe I should just make a decision based on general principles.\n\nGiven the pot odds (31% equity needed) and my hand's approximate 32% equity against a tight range, it's a borderline call. However, being out of position reduces my postflop profitability. In tournament poker, defending the BB with 56o against an UTG raise is generally a fold at these stack depths (111 BB). At shorter stacks (like 20-30 BB), calling becomes more attractive due to implied odds being better relative to stack sizes.\n\nAlso, the raise size is 3x BB (6 total, so 4 more over my BB). That's a standard raise.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. I'll save my chips for better spots. Let me craft the JSON response.",

So I need to call 1 more to match the BB of 2. Pot is 5 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 2 call). I have 221 chips (110.5 BB). My hand is terrible: 4h7s offsuit, not connected, not suited. In the small blind, I could complete with some speculative hands, but 74o is one of the worst hands. I'm getting 5:1 pot odds (call 1 to win 5). That's good odds, but the hand is so weak that I'll likely be dominated postflop. I'm out of position against the BB (Seat 4) and the caller (Seat 2). The BB could raise, making my call wasted.\n\nI should consider folding. However, I recall that in tournaments, sometimes completing the SB with any two cards can be okay if getting good odds. But 74o is really bad. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I can use tools to recall opponent actions. Let me first search for observations about these opponents.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the small blind with 4h 7s, which is a very weak hand. The pot is 5 chips (1 from my SB, 2 from BB, and 2 from Kimi-K2's call). I need to call 1 more chip to complete the blind.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 7, 8, 12). In hand 7, they raised to 6 from early position. In hand 8, they raised to 6 from UTG. In hand 12, they raised to 6 from UTG. So Kimi-K2 seems to be an aggressive player who raises preflop with decent hands.\n\nHowever, in this hand, Kimi-K2 just called from UTG (seat 2). That's interesting - they didn't raise. This might indicate a weaker hand than their usual raising range. They're the only player in the pot besides me and the BB.\n\nI have 4h 7s - this is a terrible hand, especially out of position. I'm in the small blind, which means I'll be first to act postflop. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 1 chip to win a pot of 5 chips (if BB folds) or 6 chips (if BB calls). That's 5:1 or 6:1 pot odds. However, with such a weak hand and being out of position, these pot odds aren't great.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 221 chips (110.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. Kimi-K2 has 185 chips. The BB has 214 chips.\n\nGiven my weak hand, being out of position, and the fact that I'd be playing against at least one opponent (Kimi-K2), folding seems correct. Even though it's only 1 chip, 4h7s is just too weak to play from the small blind, especially when we have to act first on every street.\n\nThe BB might raise behind me, which would put me in an even worse spot.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for better opportunities. Let me check if there are any other factors... The search shows I've been folding to Kimi-K2's raises in previous hands (hands 7, 12). That's consistent with good play.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is the SB and has been fairly tight - folded 3 of 4 hands preflop, but did call once and bet on flop once. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is BB and has folded a lot preflop too (folded 4 of 5 hands preflop, called once).\n\nThe blinds are small relative to stacks (110.5 BB effective). With K5o on the button, this is a marginal spot. The button is a great stealing position, but K5o is weak. However, both blinds seem fairly passive/foldy preflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 5 (3 in pot + my 2 call), so I'm getting 2.5:1 odds, which is decent.\n\nBut raising might be better to try to steal the blinds. Minimum raise to 4 would be putting in 4 to win 3, which is worse odds but could win it outright.\n\nGiven my position and opponent tendencies, I think a small raise could work. If I get called, I have position and a King-high hand that might be best if they have weak holdings.\n\nHowever, K5o is really weak. The King is good but the 5 is a terrible kicker. If either blind has any decent hand, I'm in trouble.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. My stack is healthy at 110.5 BB, no need to play marginal hands.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament strategy. With deep stacks, I can be more selective. K5o is not a hand I want to play, even on the button. The risk of getting called by a better hand and playing out of position postflop (well, actually I'd have position) isn't worth it.\n\nI should fold.",

They could easily raise behind me, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding weak hands from early positions (folded K2c from UTG in hand #15, folded 89s from UTG in hand #10).

However, with such a weak hand and poor position, pot odds don't justify playing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with marginal hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nLooking at opponent actions from previous hand: They seem fairly standard.

There's no reason to play this weak hand out of position.\n\nThe pot is 3 chips, and it costs 2 chips to call. Even though it's only 2 chips, calling with this hand would be a mistake because I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak holding.\n\nI should just fold. No need to get involved with this hand. Let me check if there are any other considerations... The opponents include various AI players, but without specific reads, I should stick to fundamental strategy.\n\nMy action: fold. Reason: Weak hand (3s Tc) from UTG position, deep stack allows waiting for better spots, playing this hand out of position is -EV.",

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total from what appears to be middle position. The action is on me in the small blind. I need to call 10 more chips (since I already posted 2 as SB).\n\nFirst, I should consider my hand strength: KJo is a decent hand, but not premium. It's suited, which helps. In the small blind, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand, which is a disadvantage.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's raise. They raised to 12 (3x the BB). That's a standard raise size. I don't have information about this opponent's tendencies yet.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win a pot that will be 30 after my call (currently 18 + my 10 = 28, plus the BB's action? Wait, actually the pot is currently 18: 2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from raiser. If I call, I add 10, making it 28. Then the BB still has to act, so the pot could grow more).\n\nActually, I need to consider that the BB still has to act after me. If I call, the BB might raise, which would put me in a tough spot.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack of 53.8 BB. I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\nPosition: Being out of position with KJo is not ideal. I'll have to act first on every street.\n\nAlternatives: I could fold, call, or raise. Raising would be aggressive but might isolate the raiser. However, KJo is not a great hand to 3-bet with from out of position.\n\nLet me check if I have any information about this opponent. I should use the recall_opponent_actions tool to see Seat 2's tendencies. But wait, I need to respond in JSON format. The system is telling me I'm not responding correctly. I need to make a decision first, then I can use tools if needed, but I should respond with the JSON.\n\nActually, I think I should use the tools to inform my decision.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the small blind with Ks Jd. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total (making it 8 more than the BB). I need to call 10 chips (since I already put in 2). My stack is 215 chips (53.8 BB). Looking at opponent's history: they've mostly folded preflop (6 out of 10 actions), called twice in late positions when facing limps, and raised once previously (hand #21). This is their second raise in recent hands.\n\nKJo is a decent hand, but not premium. I'm out of position (small blind), which is a disadvantage. The opponent has shown some recent aggression with two raises in a row. The pot is currently 18 (my 2 SB + BB 4 + raise 12). If I call, I put in 10 more for a total pot of 28.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and KJo is marginal, but the opponent might be widening their range, I could consider a 3-bet to take initiative. However, with 53.8 BB stack, I need to be careful. A 3-bet to around 28-30 total might be reasonable. Let me check if raising is a legal action - yes, it is.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's history: they raised last hand (hand #21) and now raised again. This could indicate they're getting active. KJo has decent equity against a wide range. I could 3-bet to test their strength or call and play cautiously postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have a healthy stack, but not huge. Folding is too weak. Calling is okay but puts me out of position. Raising could win the pot now or define their hand.\n\nI think a small 3-bet to 28 total (adding 26 more) is reasonable. That would make it 16 more for opponent to call. If they're raising light, they might fold. If they call, I have initiative and can c-bet on favorable flops.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise to: 20 total. So I need to raise to at least 20. 28 seems good. If they 4-bet, I can fold. If they call, I have position disadvantage but initiative.\n\nActually, I'm in SB, so I'll be first to act postflop. That's even worse. Maybe just call or fold. But KJo is too strong to fold for 10 more chips. I'll call and play cautiously.\n\nWait, I should consider the BB behind me. BB hasn't acted yet (Seat 4). They still need to act after me. So if I call, BB might squeeze. That's another consideration.\n\nGiven all this, I think calling is the most balanced approach. I'll see the flop and decide. If BB squeezes, I can fold.\n\nLet me decide: call.",

The pot odds are 6:4 (1.5:1), but implied odds are poor with such a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (51 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies (both blinds folding frequently), I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but with such a weak hand, if either blind calls or raises, I'm in trouble.

I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.\n\nLet me check if there are any tournament considerations - we're in a tournament, but with 51 BBs, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands.\n\nThe JSON response should be: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2-5 offsuit is one of the weakest starting hands, especially from UTG position. Folding preserves chips for better opportunities.\"\n}",

Let me think about this hand.\n\nFirst, my hand: 6s Qc is a weak hand - Queen-high with a low kicker, offsuit. Not a strong starting hand. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 4 chips. The raise is to 12, so I need to call 8 more to see a flop.\n\nPot odds: Pot is currently 18 (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8, so pot odds are 8 to win 18, which is about 2.25:1 or 31% equity needed.\n\nBut I should consider opponent tendencies. The opponent is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" - seems like an AI opponent. Without specific history, I should assume standard play. A raise from UTG (Seat 1) could be a decent range.\n\nWith Q6o, I'm dominated by many hands in a UTG raising range. Even if I hit a Queen, I could be outkicked. The hand has little potential for straights or flushes.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 50 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\nI should probably fold. But let me check if there's any reason to call. In the BB, getting 2.25:1 odds, but with such a weak hand that plays poorly postflop, it's likely -EV.\n\nBetter to preserve chips for better spots. Q6o is a clear fold against an UTG raise.\n\nMy action: fold.\n\nNow I need to output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nPosition: SB with T9 suited (clubs)\nStack: 199 chips (49.8 BB)\nAction: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB)\nAmount to call: 10 chips (since we already posted SB of 2)\nPot: 18 chips currently\n\nFrom opponent data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times: hand 21 (12), hand 22 (12), hand 25 (32)\n- This is a 3x raise which seems to be his standard opening size\n- He seems to be fairly active preflop\n\nMy hand: T9s is a decent speculative hand from SB, but facing a raise. The suited connector has good implied odds if we hit a flop hard, but we're out of position which is a big disadvantage.\n\nPot odds: We need to call 10 to win 18 (current pot) + 10 (our call) = 28. That's about 1.8:1 odds, or 35.7% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands), T9s has about 40-42% equity. However, being out of position reduces our effective equity significantly. We'll have to act first on every street.\n\nTournament considerations: We have a healthy 50BB stack, so not desperate. Folding here preserves our stack.\n\nAlternative: We could 3-bet, but T9s isn't a great 3-betting hand, especially out of position. We'd be bluffing with a hand that has decent equity but not great.\n\nGiven the out-of-position disadvantage and the fact that we're not getting great pot odds (need ~36% equity but out of position reduces effective equity), I think fold is correct. We can find better spots with position.\n\nLet me check if there's any specific read on Kimi-K2's postflop play. The search didn't show much, but from the action recall, he seems to continuation bet (hand 22 he bet 20 on flop after raising preflop). So he's likely to c-bet which puts pressure on us out of position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop frequently: 6 chips (1.5x) in early hands, then 12 chips (3x), and recently 32 chips (8x) in hand 25, and 12 chips (3x) in hand 27. In hand 27 they showed Kd9d, so they're raising with suited connectors and likely a wide range.\n\nMy hand: Qs3s - suited queen with weak kicker. I'm on the button, which is good position, but facing a raise from seat 2 (UTG? Actually seat 2 is likely UTG or MP depending on table size). Let me check table positions: Seat 1 folded (UTG?), seat 2 raised (UTG+1?), I'm BTN (seat 3), seat 4 is SB, seat 5 is BB.\n\nThe raise is to 16 chips (4x BB). My stack is 199 chips (49.8 BB). Pot is currently: SB (2) + BB (4) + raise (16) = 22. I need to call 16 to win 22, giving me 1.375:1 pot odds (42% needed). Q3s vs a likely wide range has maybe 35-40% equity? Actually against a reasonable UTG range, Q3s has ~35% equity. Against a wider range it could be better.\n\nBut position is key: I'm on button, so I have position postflop. However, there are still SB and BB to act after me. They have short stacks (MiniMax-M2 has 107 chips, GPT-OSS-120B has 262 chips). SB might call or fold, BB might defend.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49.8 BB, which is healthy. Q3s is a marginal hand. Facing a 4x raise from UTG, even with position, it's questionable. The opponent has shown willingness to raise with speculative hands like K9s, so their range might be wider than typical UTG.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've played similar spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Ks Ah on a 7h Td 4d board. I raised preflop to 16 and Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called. Now on the flop, the pot is 38 chips, and it's my action with amount to call = 0 (so I can check or raise). I have AK offsuit, which is top pair top kicker on this board. The flop is 7h Td 4d, giving me a pair of tens with ace kicker (actually board has Td, so I have top pair with ace kicker). There's a flush draw with two diamonds, but I have no diamonds.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 91 chips total, so they have a short stack. They called my preflop raise from presumably the button or cutoff? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, seat 5 is SB, seat 1 is BB? Let me check: Seat 5 posted SB 2, Seat 1 posted BB 4, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 (me) raised to 16, Seat 4 called 16, Seat 5 folded, Seat 1 folded. So Seat 4 is in the cutoff or maybe button? Actually seat numbering: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3: me (BB), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2, Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (folded). So after me (BB), action goes to Seat 4 who called. That means Seat 4 is UTG? Wait, typical order: SB (seat 5), BB (seat 1), then UTG (seat 2), etc. But here Seat 1 is BB, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 (me) raised from... actually I'm seat 3, but I'm BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So I'm the big blind. Then Seat 4 is UTG? Actually after BB, it goes to UTG (seat 2), but seat 2 folded. Then seat 3 (me) acted? Wait, I'm seat 3, but I already posted BB? The preflop actions: Seat 5 post_sb 2, Seat 1 post_bb 4, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 raise 16, Seat 4 call 16, Seat 5 fold, Seat 1 fold. So I raised from the BB after the BB was posted by Seat 1? That's confusing. Maybe Seat 1 is actually the BB, but I'm seat 3? Let's assume I'm BB (seat 3) and Seat 1 is something else. Anyway, not critical.\n\nImportant: I have top pair top kicker on a dry board except for flush draw. My opponent called preflop raise. They could have a wide range: pairs, suited connectors, maybe Ax, KQ, etc. They have a short stack (91 chips). The pot is 38, and I have 183 chips (45.8 BB). They have about 22.75 BB.\n\nI should consider betting for value and protection. I want to charge flush draws and weaker hands. Since they have a short stack, they might be willing to go all-in with draws or pairs. I should bet maybe 2/3 pot to 3/4 pot. Minimum raise to is 12, meaning I can bet any amount from 12 up to my stack.\n\nBut first, let me use tools to recall opponent tendencies. I'll search for MiniMax-M2 actions.",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. We're on the turn with Ks Ah (Ace-King offsuit). The board is 7h Td 4d Th (paired tens with two diamonds). We raised preflop to 16, got called by seat 4 (MiniMax-M2). We bet 25 on the flop, and they called. Now on the turn, we have 158 chips total, opponent has 66 chips total (short stack). Pot is 88 chips. We have position (BB vs seat 4 who is presumably button? Actually seat 4 is to our left, so we're out of position? Let me check: seats: 1 folded, 2 folded, 3 is us (BB), 4 is MiniMax, 5 folded. So we're BB, seat 4 is UTG or MP? Actually with 5 players, seat 4 is CO? Wait, we need to reconstruct: 5 players total, seat 5 was SB, seat 1 was BB, seat 2 folded, we (seat 3) raised, seat 4 called, seat 5 (SB) folded, seat 1 (BB) folded. So we're seat 3 (BB) and seat 4 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 5 SB, seat 1 BB, seat 2 UTG, seat 3 us (BB? Wait we're seat 3, but we posted BB? Actually hand says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So seat 3 is BB, seat 4 is UTG? That seems weird. But anyway, we're out of position relative to seat 4.\n\nOur hand: AK offsuit. Board: 7h Td 4d Th. We have ace high with a backdoor flush draw (spades, but board has diamonds). Actually we have Ks Ah, so we have no flush draw. We have overcards: Ace and King. The board is paired tens, so there's trips possible. Opponent called preflop and flop. What could they have? Looking at their history: They've shown down Tc9s (ten-nine suited) in hand 24, and Ac8d in hand 27. They seem to call with a variety of hands. They called preflop with our raise to 16. That's 4BB raise. They have 66 chips total, so they's short-stacked (16.5BB). They called 25 on flop (pot was ~40? Actually preflop pot: our 16 + their 16 = 32, plus blinds 2+4 = 6? Wait SB 2, BB 4, but SB folded, BB folded. So pot preflop: 16+16+2+4 = 38. We bet 25, they called, pot becomes 88. They have 66 chips total, they've put in 16+25 = 41 already, leaving 25 chips behind. So they're effectively pot-committed.\n\nOur stack: 158 chips, we've put in 16+25 = 41, leaving 117 behind.\n\nOn turn, we can check or raise (minimum raise to 25, but we can bet any amount up to all-in). Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Or we can bet for value/protection.\n\nWhat hands do we beat? If opponent has a lower pocket pair (like 99, 88, etc), we're ahead. If they have a ten, we're behind. If they have a draw (like diamonds), we're ahead but vulnerable. They could have a smaller ace (A7, A4, AT maybe). AT would be trips. A7 would be two pair (sevens and tens). A4 would be two pair (fours and tens). They could have a pocket pair below ten.\n\nGiven they called preflop and flop, they likely have something decent. Could be a ten, could be a draw, could be a medium pair.\n\nWe have 6 outs to improve to a pair (3 aces, 3 kings), but some of those might not be clean if opponent has a ten (an ace or king would give us pair but still lose to trips). Actually if opponent has a ten, we need two pair or better. If we hit an ace or king, we'd have one pair, still losing to trips. So we need to hit runner-runner for two pair or trips. Not great.\n\nBut we might have the best hand now. Let's consider pot odds: If we bet, we can try to get them to fold. They have only 25 chips left, so they're getting good odds to call any bet. If we bet small, they'll likely call with any pair or draw. If we bet all-in (117), they'd have"

          "content": "Let me look at hand 24 and 27 to see how they played. Hand 24 they had Tc9s and called a raise preflop (4BB? Actually they called 4). They called flop bet 20, turn bet 50. Hand 27 they had Ac8d and called preflop raise to 8 (2BB?), called flop bet 16. So they tend to call with marginal hands. They have shown down Tc9s and Ac8d. They're a calling station.\n\nNow our situation: They have only 25 chips left. Pot is 88. If we bet, they're getting great odds to call with any piece. They're pot-committed. If we check, they might bet their remaining 25 on river if they improve or if they think we're weak. But they might check back.\n\nOur hand: AK high on paired board. We're likely behind if they have a ten. But they could have a draw (diamonds), a smaller pair (like 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, etc), or a weaker ace. Given they called preflop raise, their range includes: pocket pairs 22-JJ, suited connectors, broadways, maybe some suited aces. They have 66 chips total, so they's short-stacked and might be playing any two cards hoping to double up.\n\nWe have 117 behind. If we bet, we should consider sizing. Minimum raise is 25, but we can bet any amount. If we bet small like 25, they'll call with almost anything getting 88+25+25=138 pot, they need to call 25, so 5.5:1 odds. They'll call with any pair, any draw, maybe even ace high. If we bet larger, say 50, they still have to call 50 into 138+50=188, needing 3.76:1 odds. They might fold some weak draws but likely call with any pair. If we go all-in 117, they have to call 117 into 88+117=205, needing 1.75:1 odds. They'll call with any pair, any draw.\n\nGiven they're short-stacked and pot-committed, betting might just get them to call with better hands and fold worse hands. Actually, if they have a draw, they might call. If they have a weak pair, they might call. If they have a ten, they'll call. So betting doesn't accomplish much except maybe get value from draws and weaker pairs. But we're not sure we're ahead.\n\nIf we check, we can see what they do on river. They might check back, then we can decide to bluff or value bet on river depending on card. Or they might bet their last 25, and we can call if we think we might be ahead. Pot odds would be 88+25=113, we need to call 25, getting 4.5:1. We'd need ~18% equity. If we're behind to a ten, we have 6 outs (aces and kings) but some might not be clean. If they have a ten, we need two pair or better. So we have maybe 6 outs to pair, but still lose to trips. So our equity vs a ten is low. But if they have a smaller pair, we're ahead and they have maybe 2 outs to improve. So checking might be good to control pot size and avoid committing more chips when behind.\n\nBut we have position? Actually we're out of position? Wait, we're BB, they're seat 4. Who acts first on turn? The player after the dealer? Let's see: preflop action went: seat 5 SB, seat 1 BB, seat 2 fold, seat 3 (us) raise, seat 4 call, seat 5 fold, seat 1 fold. So we're seat 3, they're seat 4. On flop, first to act is seat 4? Actually after preflop, the last aggressor is seat 3 (us). So we act first on flop. We bet, they called. On turn, we act first again? Yes, because we were the last aggressor on flop. So we're out of position. We act first on turn. So we need to decide now.\n\nGiven we're out of position and opponent is short-stacked, I think checking is reasonable. We can check-call a small bet on river if we think we might be ahead. Or check-fold if they bet large (but they only have 25 left). Actually they only have 25 left, so any bet on river will be 25 or less. So we can check-call any river bet getting good odds.\n\nAlternatively, we could bet small like 25 to charge draws, but they might raise all-in (they"

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. We're on the turn with Ks Ah (Ace-King offsuit). The board is 7h Td 4d Th (paired tens with two diamonds). We raised preflop to 16, got called by seat 4 (MiniMax-M2). We bet 25 on the flop, and they called. Now on the turn, we have 158 chips total, opponent has 66 chips total (short stack). Pot is 88 chips. We have position (BB vs seat 4 who is presumably button? Actually seat 4 is to our left, so we're out of position? Let me check: seats: 1 folded, 2 folded, 3 is us (BB), 4 is MiniMax, 5 folded. So we're BB, seat 4 is UTG or MP? Actually with 5 players, seat 4 is CO? Wait, we need to reconstruct: 5 players total, seat 5 was SB, seat 1 was BB, seat 2 folded, we (seat 3) raised, seat 4 called, seat 5 (SB) folded, seat 1 (BB) folded. So we're seat 3 (BB) and seat 4 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 5 SB, seat 1 BB, seat 2 UTG, seat 3 us (BB? Wait we're seat 3, but we posted BB? Actually hand says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So seat 3 is BB, seat 4 is UTG? That seems weird. But anyway, we're out of position relative to seat 4.\n\nOur hand: AK offsuit. Board: 7h Td 4d Th. We have ace high with a backdoor flush draw (spades, but board has diamonds). Actually we have Ks Ah, so we have no flush draw. We have overcards: Ace and King. The board is paired tens, so there's trips possible. Opponent called preflop and flop. What could they have? Looking at their history: They've shown down Tc9s (ten-nine suited) in hand 24, and Ac8d in hand 27. They seem to call with a variety of hands. They called preflop with our raise to 16. That's 4BB raise. They have 66 chips total, so they's short-stacked (16.5BB). They called 25 on flop (pot was ~40? Actually preflop pot: our 16 + their 16 = 32, plus blinds 2+4 = 6? Wait SB 2, BB 4, but SB folded, BB folded. So pot preflop: 16+16+2+4 = 38. We bet 25, they called, pot becomes 88. They have 66 chips total, they've put in 16+25 = 41 already, leaving 25 chips behind. So they're effectively pot-committed.\n\nOur stack: 158 chips, we've put in 16+25 = 41, leaving 117 behind.\n\nOn turn, we can check or raise (minimum raise to 25, but we can bet any amount up to all-in). Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Or we can bet for value/protection.\n\nWhat hands do we beat? If opponent has a lower pocket pair (like 99, 88, etc), we're ahead. If they have a ten, we're behind. If they have a draw (like diamonds), we're ahead but vulnerable. They could have a smaller ace (A7, A4, AT maybe). AT would be trips. A7 would be two pair (sevens and tens). A4 would be two pair (fours and tens). They could have a pocket pair below ten.\n\nGiven they called preflop and flop, they likely have something decent. Could be a ten, could be a draw, could be a medium pair.\n\nWe have 6 outs to improve to a pair (3 aces, 3 kings), but some of those might not be clean if opponent has a ten (an ace or king would give us pair but still lose to trips). Actually if opponent has a ten, we need two pair or better. If we hit an ace or king, we'd have one pair, still losing to trips. So we need to hit runner-runner for two pair or trips. Not great.\n\nBut we might have the best hand now. Let's consider pot odds: If we bet, we can try to get them to fold. They have only 25 chips left, so they're getting good odds to call any bet. If we bet small, they'll likely call with any pair or draw. If we bet all-in (117), they'd have",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me look at hand 24 and 27 to see how they played. Hand 24 they had Tc9s and called a raise preflop (4BB? Actually they called 4). They called flop bet 20, turn bet 50. Hand 27 they had Ac8d and called preflop raise to 8 (2BB?), called flop bet 16. So they tend to call with marginal hands. They have shown down Tc9s and Ac8d. They're a calling station.\n\nNow our situation: They have only 25 chips left. Pot is 88. If we bet, they're getting great odds to call with any piece. They're pot-committed. If we check, they might bet their remaining 25 on river if they improve or if they think we're weak. But they might check back.\n\nOur hand: AK high on paired board. We're likely behind if they have a ten. But they could have a draw (diamonds), a smaller pair (like 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, etc), or a weaker ace. Given they called preflop raise, their range includes: pocket pairs 22-JJ, suited connectors, broadways, maybe some suited aces. They have 66 chips total, so they's short-stacked and might be playing any two cards hoping to double up.\n\nWe have 117 behind. If we bet, we should consider sizing. Minimum raise is 25, but we can bet any amount. If we bet small like 25, they'll call with almost anything getting 88+25+25=138 pot, they need to call 25, so 5.5:1 odds. They'll call with any pair, any draw, maybe even ace high. If we bet larger, say 50, they still have to call 50 into 138+50=188, needing 3.76:1 odds. They might fold some weak draws but likely call with any pair. If we go all-in 117, they have to call 117 into 88+117=205, needing 1.75:1 odds. They'll call with any pair, any draw.\n\nGiven they're short-stacked and pot-committed, betting might just get them to call with better hands and fold worse hands. Actually, if they have a draw, they might call. If they have a weak pair, they might call. If they have a ten, they'll call. So betting doesn't accomplish much except maybe get value from draws and weaker pairs. But we're not sure we're ahead.\n\nIf we check, we can see what they do on river. They might check back, then we can decide to bluff or value bet on river depending on card. Or they might bet their last 25, and we can call if we think we might be ahead. Pot odds would be 88+25=113, we need to call 25, getting 4.5:1. We'd need ~18% equity. If we're behind to a ten, we have 6 outs (aces and kings) but some might not be clean. If they have a ten, we need two pair or better. So we have maybe 6 outs to pair, but still lose to trips. So our equity vs a ten is low. But if they have a smaller pair, we're ahead and they have maybe 2 outs to improve. So checking might be good to control pot size and avoid committing more chips when behind.\n\nBut we have position? Actually we're out of position? Wait, we're BB, they're seat 4. Who acts first on turn? The player after the dealer?

Actually after preflop, the last aggressor is seat 3 (us). So we act first on flop. We bet, they called. On turn, we act first again? Yes, because we were the last aggressor on flop.

The river paired the fours, making the board: Ten-Ten-Four-Four-Seven.\n\nMy hand: AK high. I have no pair, just ace-high with king kicker. The board is paired twice, so anyone with a ten or four has at least a full house. A ten would have quads (four tens). A four would have a full house (fours full of tens). A seven would have two pair (tens and fours with sevens).\n\nHand history: I raised preflop to 16, bet 25 on flop, checked turn, opponent checked back. Now river is a 4s, pairing the board.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 seems to be a calling station - called a 50 chip bet on turn in hand 24, called preflop and flop bets in hand 27. They tend to check when checked to.\n\nMy hand strength: I have just ace-high. This is a terrible hand on this board. The only hands I beat are pure bluffs or worse ace-high hands. Given the paired board and opponent's calling tendencies, they likely have at least a pair, possibly a ten or four.\n\nPot odds: Checking is free. If I bet and get called, I'm likely losing. If I bet and they raise, I have to fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 158 chips, opponent has 66 chips. If I bet and get called/raised, I could lose a significant portion of my stack.\n\nDecision: I should check. There's no value in betting with ace-high on this board. My opponent checked back the turn when I checked, suggesting they don't have a strong hand either, but they could have been slow-playing a monster or have a medium strength hand. Checking allows me to see a showdown for free and potentially win if they have nothing.\n\nLet me check if there are any showdowns with this opponent to see what they show up with.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format, but first I want to understand the situation better. Let me think through this hand:\n\nWe're on the river with Ks Ah (Ace-King offsuit). The board is 7h Td 4d Th 4s - it's paired twice (Tens and Fours) with a flush draw that missed. We raised preflop from BB to 16, MiniMax-M2 called from SB with 66 chips total. We bet 25 on the flop, they called. We checked turn, they checked.\n\nNow on the river, we have top pair with Ace kicker (pair of Tens with Ace kicker). The board is double-paired, so there are possible full houses. MiniMax-M2 has only 66 chips total, and they've called our preflop raise and flop bet. They checked back the turn when given a free card.\n\nWe need to decide whether to value bet or check. Let me consider:\n\n1. Our hand: AKo, we have top pair with Ace kicker on a T-T-4-4-7 board. This is essentially a bluff catcher now - we beat any single Ten or lower pair, but lose to any Ten with better kicker (though unlikely given our Ace), any full house (T-T or 4-4), or quads.\n\n2. Opponent's range: They called preflop from SB with a short stack of 66 chips. They called flop bet and checked turn. With only 25 chips left (66 total - 16 preflop - 25 flop = 25 left), they're pot-committed. Their range could include pocket pairs (maybe 77-99, JJ, QQ), suited connectors, Ax hands, maybe some Tens.\n\n3. Board texture: Double-paired board reduces the value of our top pair. Many hands that called flop could have improved to full house on river (any Ten or Four).\n\n4. Stack sizes: We have 158 chips, opponent has 25 left. Pot is 88. If we bet, we should bet small for value against weaker Tens or pocket pairs. But opponent is pot-committed with any decent hand.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: We're at 39.5 BB, healthy but not huge. Winning this pot would be good.\n\nGiven opponent only has 25 chips left, they're likely calling any bet with any piece. A small value bet makes sense - maybe 15-20 chips. But we need to be careful about getting raised all-in if they have a full house.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 7h Td 4d Th 4s. The river paired the 4s. So if opponent has a Ten, they now have a full house (Tens full of Fours). If they have a Four, they have quads. Our hand is weak on this board.\n\nGiven the double-paired board and opponent's line (call preflop, call flop, check turn), they could easily have a Ten or pocket pair that improved. Checking seems safer to avoid getting raised all-in.\n\nBut we also have to consider they might have missed flush draw (diamonds) or straight draw that missed. The board is Td 4d on flop, so diamond draws missed.\n\nI think checking is prudent. We can win at showdown if they have a busted draw or weaker hand, and avoid losing more chips if they have us beat.\n\nLet me respond with check.",

Kimi-K2 (seat 2, BB) has been somewhat active - raising with hands like 25, 27, 28 preflop. They raised to 12, 16, 32 in various hands. They seem to play aggressively when they have hands.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, SB) has mostly folded recently (last 4 hands folded preflop), but did raise in hands 25 and 26.\n\n3. I have 202 chips (50.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 2/4.\n\n4. My hand 9c Ts is suited, which gives some flush potential, but it's a weak hand from UTG. It has some straight potential but is easily dominated.\n\n5. Looking at my recent hand history, I folded 9c Ts in hand 27 when I was SB. That was from a different position though.\n\n6. As UTG, I'm opening into 4 players behind me who could have strong hands. This is a fold in most standard poker strategies.\n\n7. The pot is only 6 chips, and calling 4 chips (2% of my stack) to see a flop with a weak hand from early position isn't great.\n\n8. Raising would be even worse since I'd be bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and position, folding is the correct play. I should wait for better spots to accumulate chips.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors... The minimum raise is to 8, which would commit 4% of my stack. Not worth it with this hand.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

The pot is currently 18 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from raise).\n\nFrom the opponent data, seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been fairly active preflop:\n- Hand 25: raised 32 (8x BB)\n- Hand 27: raised 12 (3x BB) - same sizing as now\n- Hand 28: raised 16 (4x BB)\n- Hands 29-31: folded preflop\n\nThey showed Kd 9d in hand 27, so they're raising with fairly wide hands.\n\nMy hand (6h 4d) is terrible:\n- Offsuit, low cards, no connectivity\n- In the small blind, out of position\n- Need to call 10 into pot of 18 (pot odds: 10/28 = 35.7%)\n- Implied odds are poor because I'm out of position with a weak hand\n\nMy stack is 202 chips (50.5 BB) - healthy but not huge. The BB (seat 4) has only 106 chips (26.5 BB) and might be short-stacked.\n\nTournament considerations: I should be preserving my stack with such a weak hand. Even if the opponent is raising wide, 64o is just too weak to defend from the small blind. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nThe BB still has to act after me, so there's also risk of a squeeze.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear choice.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7h 3h. This is a very weak hand - suited but with low rank and poor connectivity. The blinds are 2/4, my stack is 202 chips (50.5 BB). Two players have folded, leaving me to act against the small blind (MiniMax-M2, 122 chips) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B, 262 chips).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been fairly active, calling preflop in recent hands (called 8 in hand 32, called 16 in hand 29). Also bet 20 on flop in hand 32. Seems willing to play hands from SB.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded hands 25-32 except hand 30 where they raised to 12). Only one raise in the last 10 hands.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4), and I need to call 4 to see the flop. With position (button) and a suited hand, there might be some speculative value, but 73s is extremely weak.\n\nPot odds: 4 to call into 6 pot = 1.5:1 odds, needing about 40% equity. Against typical SB/BB ranges, 73s has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Implied odds could be better since I have position, but with such a weak hand, I'll rarely make strong enough hands to win big pots.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 50.5 BB stack. No need to take marginal spots with terrible hands. Folding preserves chips for better opportunities.\n\nGiven the weakness of 73s, even with position, I should fold. The small blind might call or raise, and the big blind could check or raise. I'd be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've played similar spots.",

It's a low suited connector with poor high card value. \n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 50.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. The small blind has 30.5 BB and the big blind has 65.5 BB. \n\nWith such a weak hand, folding is probably correct. Even with position, 73s has very little value. The only reason to play it would be to steal the blinds, but with two players behind me who haven't acted yet (SB and BB), and such a weak hand, it's not a good steal candidate.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but with the basic information I have, folding seems right.

I'm first to act preflop after the SB and BB have posted.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 7 hands preflop), but did raise in hands 25 and 26. Currently in BB.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been mostly folding, but raised once in hand 30. Currently in SB.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position to play from. With 93o, this hand has almost no value. It's not suited, not connected, and both cards are low. Playing this from UTG would be a major mistake.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack of 50.5 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands. Better to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nPot odds: It would cost 4 chips to call into a pot of 6 (2 SB + 4 BB). That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but the hand is so weak that even with these odds, it's not worth playing.\n\nI should fold this hand.

They seem to be an active raiser. They raised to 12 in hand #36 as well. Their raising range is likely wide.\n\nMy hand 4d6d is weak but suited connectors have good implied odds. However, I'm out of position (SB) which is a big disadvantage. The pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 10 chips to win 18, giving me 1.8:1 pot odds.\n\nIn the SB with a weak suited connector, facing a raise from an active player, I should generally fold. The positional disadvantage is huge, and 64s needs specific flops to continue. Even if I hit a draw, playing OOP will be difficult.\n\nMy recent hands show I've been folding a lot (30 folds out of 36 hands). My stack is healthy at 49 BB, so no need to take marginal spots.\n\nBetter to wait for better spots in position or with stronger hands. Fold.",

Stack preservation at 49 BB is important, and this marginal hand can lead to difficult postflop decisions. Better to wait for stronger stealing opportunities.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with Js 9h. Two players have folded, leaving only the small blind (MiniMax-M2 with 136 chips) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B with 262 chips). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop, with the option to raise to at least 8.\n\nLooking at my hand: J9o is a marginal hand, but I'm on the button which is the best position. The players left are the blinds who are forced to put money in. This is a classic steal opportunity.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) has folded to raises several times (hands 28, 35, 36, 37). They called a raise with 64o in hand 32 and then bet the flop. They also called with Ks Ah in hand 29. They seem to play somewhat passively preflop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has raised a few times (hands 30, 35) and folded to raises (hand 28). They have 262 chips, which is the biggest stack at the table.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (49 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so this is a good spot to attempt a steal with position.\n\nHowever, J9o is not a great hand. It's offsuit and has limited connectivity. The standard play here would be to fold marginal hands from early position, but on the button against just the blinds, a raise could be profitable.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Fold: Conservative play with a marginal hand\n2. Call: See a cheap flop with position but give the blinds a free look\n3. Raise: Attempt to steal the blinds, but risk being called by one or both blinds\n\nGiven that the SB has shown some willingness to call raises (hand 29, 32) and the BB has raised a few times, a raise might get called. But with position, I can outplay them postflop.\n\nActually, looking at hand 29, I raised with AKs from CO and got called by MiniMax-M2. So they do call raises sometimes.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips currently. A raise to 12-16 would be standard. If I raise to 12, I'm risking 12 to win 6, needing to succeed about 67% of the time to be profitable. If both blinds fold, I win 6 chips.\n\nBut if I get called, I'll have position with a marginal hand. J9o can hit straights and pairs, but it's not great.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my stack size (49 BB), I think the best play is to fold. J9o is just too weak, even on the button. I should wait for better stealing opportunities with stronger hands or better connectivity.\n\nHowever, some players might argue for a small raise. But looking at my history, I've been folding a lot (31 folds out of 37 hands). Maybe I should be more aggressive. But J9o is really not a good hand to get involved with.\n\nActually, let me check the pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1 odds, or 40% equity needed. J9o has about 35-40% equity against random hands, so calling might be okay mathematically. But then I'm out of position against the SB who acts first postflop.\n\nWait, no - I'm on the button, so I have position against both blinds. The SB acts first, then BB, then me. So I have the best position.\n\nCalling 4 chips to see a flop with position might be okay, but then I'm playing a weak hand out of position relative to the flop betting (SB acts first).\n\nI think the prudent tournament play is to fold. My stack is healthy at 49 BB, no need to risk chips with J9o. I should wait for better spots.\n\nBut let me consider: if I fold, the blinds just get the pot. If I raise, I might steal it. If I call, I see a flop cheaply.\n\nActually, in tournament poker, preserving chips is important. J9o is a trouble hand that can get me into difficult spots postflop. I'll go with fold.",

However, it's suited and could potentially make a flush, but it's very weak. I'm in a tournament, need to preserve chips. Let me check if there's any information about opponents.\n\nFirst, I'll use recall_opponent_actions to see if there are any patterns from Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) or Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) since they act after me.

The big blind is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 162 chips.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has folded preflop 3 times, called twice (once from SB, once from BB). Seems tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop twice (hand 35 and 38), folded 3 times. Shows some aggression.\n\nMy hand 4d Td is weak, especially from UTG. Suited connectors have some potential but T4s is one of the worst suited hands. From UTG, this is a clear fold in most tournament situations. With 49 BB, I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nThere are still 4 players to act after me (including blinds), so there's significant risk of getting raised behind me. Even if I call, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 to win 6 (current pot) + 4 (my call) = 10, so 4:10 or 2.5:1. But with such a weak hand and poor position, these odds aren't sufficient given the reverse implied odds (if I hit a weak pair, I could lose more chips).\n\nTournament considerations: With 49 BB, I'm in good shape and should avoid marginal spots from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in UTG position with Qh 3c. This is a very weak hand - Queen-three offsuit. UTG is the worst position to play from, and this hand has very little potential. Looking at my hand history, I've been folding most hands, which is appropriate for my position and chip stack.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (49 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. However, with this weak hand in UTG, I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play post-flop.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the search results: I see Kimi-K2 has raised preflop several times (hands 32, 36, 37). GPT-OSS-120B has also raised preflop (hands 30, 35). So there are aggressive players at the table.\n\nWith Q3o in UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has minimal preflop value, poor post-flop playability, and I'm out of position against the entire table. Even if I hit a Queen, I'll be vulnerable to better kickers. The 3 is essentially a dead card.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with marginal hands, especially from early position. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nPot odds: Would need to call 4 into pot of 6 (2+4), so getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds are poor with this hand since it's unlikely to make a strong hand that can win a big pot.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker strategy - fold weak hands from early position.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7d 3h, which is a terrible hand. My stack is 196 chips (24.5 BB). The blinds are 4/8. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24 from what position? Let me see: Seat 5 is likely UTG or MP? Actually, with 5 players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is... let's count: Seat 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually in 5-handed: Seat 1 is SB? Wait, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm BTN, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is... maybe CO? Let me reconstruct: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3: Me (BTN), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (BB), Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B. So action went: I posted SB 4, Seat 4 posted BB 8, Seat 5 raised to 24, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded. So Seat 5 is UTG or maybe MP? Actually with 5 players, positions: SB (Seat 1), BB (Seat 4), UTG (Seat 2), MP (Seat 5?), BTN (me). Wait, I'm Seat 3 (BTN). So Seat 5 raised from MP or CO? Let's think: If I'm BTN, then SB is Seat 4? No, SB is Seat 1 (folded), BB is Seat 4, UTG is Seat 2 (folded), MP is Seat 5? Actually typical 5-handed: SB, BB, UTG, MP, BTN. So Seat 5 is MP. So MP raised to 24 (3x BB). \n\nI have 7d 3h, which is absolutely trash. I'm on the button, which gives me positional advantage, but with this hand, I should fold. However, let me consider stack sizes: I have 196 chips, opponent has 229. The raise is to 24, which is 12.5% of my stack. If I call, pot becomes 36 + 20 = 56? Actually current pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24 = 36. If I call 20, pot becomes 56. Then BB still to act? Actually BB (Seat 4) already posted BB 8, but hasn't acted yet? Wait, actions: preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 4, Seat 4 post_bb 8, Seat 5 raise 24, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold. So action is on me (Seat 3). BB (Seat 4) still has to act after me. So if I call, BB can still raise. \n\nI should fold this hand. But maybe I can consider a steal? Actually MP raised, so he likely has a decent hand. I could 3-bet bluff? But with my stack size, a 3-bet would be committing. Minimum raise to 40, which would be 36 more (since I've already put 4). That's 20% of my stack. If I 3-bet and get called or 4-bet, I'm in trouble. \n\nBetter to fold. Let me check opponent tendencies though. Use recall_opponent_actions for GPT-OSS-120B. Also maybe search for his raising patterns. Let me do that.",

SB (MiniMax-M2) posted 4, BB (GPT-OSS-120B) posted 8. UTG and MP folded. I need to call 8 to see the flop.\n\nWith 42o, this is an extremely weak hand - no high card value, no connectivity, no suitedness. It's a trash hand. However, I'm on the button which is the best position post-flop. But still, 42o is just too weak to play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I have a 16.7% win rate and fold most hands (35 folds out of 42 hands). This suggests I'm playing tight. Looking at opponent actions, MiniMax-M2 (SB) has shown some aggression - in hand 42 they called a raise preflop and then bet on the flop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 20 (12 in pot + 8 from me), so I'm getting 2.5:1 odds. But with 42o, even with position, my equity against random hands is terrible - probably around 30% at best. However, I'm only against SB and BB who have posted blinds, so they might have weak ranges too.\n\nBut tournament considerations: I have 24.5 BB, which is a medium stack. I should preserve chips and look for better spots. Playing 42o from the button could lead to difficult post-flop situations where I'm dominated or drawing dead.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better hand. The 8 chips to call is 4% of my stack, but it's not worth it with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The BB (GPT-OSS-120B) hasn't acted yet - they could raise after I call. That would make the situation worse.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Playing Q4o from UTG is generally a losing proposition - it's dominated by many better Qx hands, has poor connectivity, and will often put me in difficult spots postflop.\n\nLooking at the tournament situation: I have 24.5 BB, which is a playable stack.

Q6o is definitely a fold from UTG. It's offsuit, weak kicker, and I'm in early position with many players left to act.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with 24.5 BB, I should be looking for better spots. Q6o is not a hand I want to play from UTG. Even if I call 8 chips (4% of my stack), I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to call into a pot of 20 (12 already + 8 from me), so I'd need about 28.6% equity. While Q6o might have some equity against random hands, it's not enough to justify playing from UTG, especially since I'll likely face raises behind me.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

Looking at the opponent's history, they've folded a lot preflop (14 out of 20 actions are folds). They raised in hand #44 to 48, and in this hand #46 they raised to 24. They also bet on the flop in hand #34. This suggests they might be raising with a wide range when they do play, given their overall tight folding tendency.\n\nMy hand Q9o is not strong, but I'm getting decent pot odds. The pot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24), and I need to call 16 more. That's pot odds of 36:16 or 2.25:1, meaning I need about 31% equity. Against a typical UTG raising range, Q9o has maybe 35-40% equity. But given this opponent's tight folding history, their raising range might be stronger.\n\nHowever, I'm in position (they're UTG, I'm BB). I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Calling 16 chips is about 8.5% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop, I can fold. If I hit something decent, I can potentially win more.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (23.5 BB). The opponent has 154 chips (19.25 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling risks 16 chips but could win a decent pot.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that the opponent might be raising light given their overall tight-passive pattern (lots of folds, only a couple raises), I think calling is reasonable. Raising with Q9o would be too aggressive. Folding is safe but might be too tight given the odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been in similar spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Qc 2d. My stack is 184 chips (23 BB). The blinds are 4/8. Everyone has folded to me, so I'm facing just the BB who posted 8. I've already posted SB 4, so I need to call 4 more to see the flop.\n\nMy hand is Q2o, which is very weak. However, I'm on the button, which is the best position. The BB has been folding quite a bit recently (folded last 3 hands preflop according to the data). From seat 4's actions, I see they've shown some aggression with raises and bets in previous hands.\n\nBut looking at the situation: I have position, and it's only 4 chips to call to see a flop in a 12-chip pot. That's getting 3:1 pot odds (12:4). However, Q2o is a terrible hand that plays poorly postflop. Even with position, it's hard to make a hand that can win.\n\nGiven my stack size (23 BB), I should be looking for better spots. Folding here preserves my stack for better opportunities. Calling with such a weak hand out of position against a single opponent who might check to me as BB could be okay, but Q2o is just too weak.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern with the BB defending blinds. Looking at the data, seat 4 has shown some aggression but also folded recently. They might check a lot as BB when facing a limp.\n\nActually, wait - I'm on the button, not out of position. I have position on the BB. So if I call, the BB checks to me, I can see a free flop. But still, Q2o is terrible.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Even though it's only 4 chips, it's still 2% of my stack, and I'll likely lose more postflop if I hit a weak pair. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, let me consider raising. I could raise to steal the blinds. But with Q2o, if I get called or 3-bet, I'm in terrible shape. And the BB has 235 chips, so they might defend.\n\nGiven the BB's recent folding trend and my position, maybe a small raise could work. But Q2o is just too weak to raise with. If I had a better hand, I'd consider raising.\n\nSo I'll fold.",

With both blinds having shown recent folding tendencies, this could be a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. However, JTo is not a super strong hand - it's a speculative hand that plays well postflop but can be dominated.\n\nPosition is excellent (button).

If I raise to 16 (minimum), that's 2x BB, which might not get enough fold equity. Better to raise to 20-24 chips.\n\nGiven the recent folding patterns of both opponents, I think a raise is good here.

This is a speculative hand - it has potential to make flushes and straights but is weak if I don't hit the flop well.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24 (3x BB). Looking at the opponent data, seat 2 has been folding a lot recently (folded preflop in hands 41-44, 46-48). In hand 45, they called a raise of 40. So this raise from seat 2 might indicate a stronger hand than usual.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (24.5 BB). The raise is to 24, which is 12% of my stack. I need to call 16 more chips (24 total - 8 already in the pot from blinds? Actually I need to call 24 total since I haven't put anything in yet).\n\nPot is currently 36 (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise).

However, I'm out of position relative to the raiser (seat 2 is likely UTG or UTG+1? Actually seat 2 raised, I'm CO, so I'm acting after them but there are players behind me - seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and seat 5 (SB) still to act).\n\nAlso, I need to consider implied odds - if I hit a flush or straight, I can win a big pot. But I also risk being raised by players behind me.\n\nGiven the opponent's recent folding pattern, this raise might be stronger than usual. My hand is speculative and I'm not in great position. The pot odds are borderline. With 24.5 BB stack, I should be careful about calling raises with speculative hands.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for a better spot.

My win rate is 16.3% over 49 hands, which suggests I'm playing tight.\n\nFrom opponent actions: I see some preflop raises from GPT-OSS-120B (48 chips in hand #45) and Kimi-K2 Thinking (24 chips in hand #46). So there are aggressive players at the table.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: With 24.5BB, I should be playing tight from early positions. 74s is not a hand worth playing UTG - it needs many players to see a flop cheaply to have implied odds, and being UTG means I'll face raises behind me.\n\nPot odds: 8 to call into 12 pot (20 total) = 2.5:1 odds, but the hand is too weak and position is terrible.\n\nBetter to wait for better spots.

So the pot is 16 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + call 4). I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Seat 2 has 152 chips.\n\nI'm in the BB, and it's heads-up against the SB who just completed.

I can check to see a free flop, or raise to try to take it down preflop.\n\nSince the opponent just completed (called the extra 4), they likely have a weak to medium hand. They might fold to a raise. A standard raise would be to 24-32 chips (3-4x). But with 5-9 offsuit, it's not a great hand to play post-flop, especially out of position (though I will have position this hand since SB acts first post-flop).\n\nActually wait: I'm BB, SB acts first preflop but post-flop, the SB acts first on each street. So I have position for the rest of the hand. That's good.\n\nGiven the weak hand and that I'm already in for 8 chips, checking to see a free flop seems reasonable. If I hit something like a pair or draw, I can continue. Otherwise, I can fold cheaply.\n\nRaising might get a fold, but if called, I'm playing a weak hand out of position with a raised pot. Not ideal.\n\nLet me check: minimum raise to is 16 (total). That's just adding 8 more chips. If I raise to 16, opponent needs to call 8 more. They might call with many hands.\n\nBetter to just check and see the flop. 5-9 offsuit is not a hand I want to put more chips in with.\n\nDecision: check. Let's see the flop.",

I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\n**Hand analysis:** I have 5c 9h on a 6s 8c Qc board. This is a weak hand - bottom pair with 9-high. I have a gutshot straight draw (7 would give me a straight), but it's not a great draw. The Q on board is likely to have hit many hands. My 9 gives me bottom pair, which is very weak.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position as BB, which makes it harder to play this hand.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Hand 49: They raised preflop to 24, then bet 48 on flop, then raised to 144 on flop (aggressive play)\n- Hand 50: They called preflop (12 chips), checked flop, folded turn\n- They seem capable of aggressive play but also cautious\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 188 chips, opponent has 152 chips. Both are relatively short (19-23.5 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 23.5 BB, I need to preserve stack but also look for spots to accumulate. This doesn't seem like a good spot to get involved with a weak hand.\n\n**Potential outcomes:** If I check, we see a turn for free. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands or draws that have good equity against me. My hand has very little showdown value and poor equity.\n\n**Decision:** Best to check and see a free turn card. If I hit my gutshot (a 7), I could potentially win a big pot. But betting here with a weak hand out of position is not good. Checking allows me to realize my equity for free and potentially bluff on later streets if the right cards come.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand (bottom pair with 9-high) out of position.

I have 188 chips total (23.5 BB). Opponent has 140 chips.\n\nMy hand: 5c 9h. I have a gutshot straight draw: I need a 7 to make a straight (5-6-7-8-9). There's also a flush draw with clubs on board (6s 8c Qc 4d - two clubs). I have 5c, so I have a flush draw too. Actually, board has two clubs: 8c and Qc. I have 5c, so I have a flush draw with three clubs. That's decent.\n\nPot odds: pot is 28 + 12 bet = 40 total if I call. I need to call 12 to win 40, so pot odds are 12/40 = 30%. My equity: I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs) and a flush draw (9 outs, but need to discount for overlapping). Actually, I have 9 clubs remaining (13 total, minus 5c, 8c, Qc = 10? Wait: 13 clubs total, I have 5c, board has 8c and Qc, so 3 seen, 10 remaining). But some clubs might also be 7c which would give me straight flush draw. However, I need to discount for possible opponent having higher flush draw. But let's estimate: I have about 12-14 outs. That's about 25-30% equity on the turn. Pot odds 30% is close.\n\nBut implied odds: if I hit my flush or straight on river, I might get more chips. Opponent has 140 chips behind, I have 188. If I call 12 now, pot becomes 52. River I could potentially bet if I hit.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Let me recall opponent actions. Use tool.",

That's 3.33:1 pot odds, or 23% equity needed.\n\nMy opponent is seat 2 (Kimi-K2). Looking at their actions: they raised preflop in hand 49 with Tc Kc, then bet flop, raised flop, then checked turn and river. They also called preflop in hand 50 and folded on turn. They seem aggressive but not overly so.\n\nMy hand: 5c 9h. I have 4 outs to a straight (any 7). That's about 8.7% equity (4/46 cards). Even if I give myself some extra outs for runner-runner flush or two pair, it's not enough to justify calling.\n\nAlso, I'm in position (BB) but opponent acted first on turn. They bet 12 into 28, which is a small bet (less than half pot). This could be a probe bet with a weak hand, but my hand is even weaker.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 188 chips (23.5 BB).

However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand if I call. The raise is 3x which is standard.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 20 to win 36, so pot odds are 20:36 or 1:1.8, meaning I need ~35.7% equity. Against a typical raising range from UTG+1 (Seat 2), AJo likely has ~40-45% equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23 BB, opponent has 18 BB. This is not a huge stack difference. If I call and BB folds, pot will be 60 with effective stack of ~140 behind (if BB folds). This creates SPR of ~2.3, which is low - postflop will be pot-committed quickly.\n\nPosition disadvantage is significant from SB. However, I could consider 3-betting given my hand strength and opponent's stack size. A 3-bet to ~60 would put pressure on opponent.\n\nLet me check if opponent has folded to 3-bets before. Let me search for 3-bet situations.",

Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's raising history: they've raised preflop 7 times with varying amounts (8, 12, 8, 8, 24, 16, 48). So they're fairly active, but the 24 raise seems standard. Kimi-K2 tends to call preflop raises fairly often.\n\nWith A4 suited, I have a speculative hand. It's suited with an ace, which gives some potential, but it's a weak ace. In the small blind, facing a button raise and a caller, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 60, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. That's decent. However, I'll be out of position against two players.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. Folding loses my 4 chip SB. Calling 20 chips is about 11% of my stack.\n\nThe hand has some implied odds if I hit a flush or straight, but with A4 suited, I'm mostly playing for flush potential or maybe an ace-high flop.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that I have a suited ace, I could consider calling. However, being out of position is a significant disadvantage.

Wait, let me check: Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16, Seat 1 raised 32. So the pot is 56 chips (SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 32). I need to call 16 more to match the 32 total.\n\nI have AJo in the BB facing a raise from the SB. This is a decent hand, but I should consider opponent tendencies. However, the user is telling me to respond with JSON, not call functions. Let me make a decision based on the information I have.\n\nAJo is a strong enough hand to continue here. I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 56, which is about 3.5:1 odds. With my stack at 10.5 BB, I should probably call or raise. AJo plays well heads-up against the SB. I could 3-bet to apply pressure, but with my stack depth, calling might be better to see a flop.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament considerations. I have 10.5 BB, which is short but not critically short. AJo is a premium hand at this stack depth. I should probably 3-bet all-in or raise significantly. Minimum raise to is 48, but I could go all-in with 168.\n\nBut wait, I should check opponent actions first using the tool... but the user says invalid format. Maybe I should just make a decision without the tool for now.\n\nGiven that I have AJo and the opponent raised from the SB, this could be a steal attempt. AJo is ahead of most SB stealing ranges. With my stack size, I should 3-bet all-in to maximize fold equity and take down the pot preflop, or get called by worse hands.\n\nLet me respond with a JSON decision.",

Actually, looking at the stack sizes: Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"out\", meaning they're eliminated. But the action says \"Seat 5 raise 283\". That must be an error or the player went all-in with their remaining chips (which would be 0). This is confusing.\n\nLet me check the situation more carefully. The pot is 307 chips. I posted SB of 8, Seat 4 posted BB of 16. Then Seat 5 raised to 283. But Seat 5 has 0 chips. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the stack display is wrong, or maybe this is a misprint. Alternatively, perhaps Seat 5 had some chips and went all-in, and the \"0 chips\" is a display error.\n\nActually, looking at the amount to call: 275 chips. That's from 283 raise minus my SB of 8? Let's calculate: I already put in 8 as SB. The raise is to 283 total. So I need to call 275 more to make my total 283.

The amount to call is 275, which is more than my entire stack. So I would be all-in if I call. But the legal actions are only fold or call - no raise option because I can't afford the minimum raise to 550.\n\nGiven that Seat 5 is marked \"out\" with 0 chips, this is very strange. Maybe this is a hand where the player is all-in with less than my stack? Or maybe there's a bug in the display. Let me use tools to gather more information.

Actually, looking at the pot size of 307 chips, that includes blinds 8+16=24, plus the raise of 283 makes 307 total. So Seat 5 raised all-in for their remaining stack. They have 0 chips left after posting? Wait, the player list shows \"GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're actually out of the tournament? But they just raised... This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"(out)\" - maybe they're already eliminated but the hand is still being played? Or maybe it's a misprint. Actually, if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. But they did raise 283. So perhaps they had chips and went all-in, leaving 0. The \"(out)\" might mean they're all-in, not eliminated.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: I have 4d 8h offsuit, one of the worst possible hands.

To call, I need to put in 283 total minus my 8 already in = 275. But I only have 208. So I can only go all-in for my remaining 208. That should be allowed as a call.\n\nBut with 4d 8h, this is an easy fold. Even if the opponent is bluffing, my hand is so weak. I'm getting poor pot odds relative to my hand strength. I should fold and preserve my stack of 216 chips (13.5 BB), which is still playable.\n\nLet me check if there's any history on Seat 5's behavior. Use the search tool.",

The interface might be showing the amount needed if I had enough chips.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 307 chips. That's 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 283 (raise) = 307. Yes. So Seat 5 raised to 283 total. I have 208 left after posting SB. To call, I need to put in 283 - 8 = 275, but I only have 208. So I can only go all-in for 208.

Even against a very wide range like any two cards, 4-8o has only about 40% equity. Against a tighter range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 13.5 BB, which is short but not desperate. I can wait for a better spot.\n\nDecision: Fold.\n\nReasoning: 4-8o is a terrible hand to call an all-in raise.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with KTo, which is a decent hand in late position. My stack is 216 chips (13.5 BB). The blinds are 8/16. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 16. Two players folded, and now it's my action.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) has raised preflop in 4 hands, with amounts 4, 4, 8, 16. These seem like small raises.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has raised preflop aggressively in many hands, including a massive 283 chip raise in hand #62 (which I just folded to in the SB with 4d8h).\n\nLooking at my own hands: I won hand #61 with JcAh by raising 168 chips preflop from BB and everyone folded. My win rate is 16% (10 wins out of 62 hands).\n\nI have 13.5 BB stack, which is short but not critically short. KTo on the button is a playable hand. The BB (GPT-OSS-120B) is aggressive and has shown willingness to 3-bet or raise big. The SB (MiniMax-M2) seems more conservative.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24 (8+16), so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, which is decent.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: KTo isn't a premium hand, but folding on the button with 13.5 BB might be too tight.\n2. Call: See a flop cheaply in position. Good if BB doesn't raise.\n3. Raise: Standard would be to 2.5-3x BB = 40-48 chips. But BB is aggressive and might 3-bet.\n\nGiven BB's aggression (283 chip raise last hand!), raising might induce a big 3-bet that I can't call. Calling might keep the pot small and let me play postflop in position.\n\nActually, with 13.5 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory. KTo might be a decent hand to open-shove with this stack size. Let me think: Standard short-stack strategy says with 10-15 BB, you can shove from late position with a wide range. KTo is definitely in that range.\n\nBut I need to consider the opponents. BB is aggressive and has a big stack (291 chips, ~18 BB). He might call with a wide range. SB has 189 chips (~11.8 BB) and might call.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks: SB has 189 (11.8 BB), BB has 291 (18.2 BB). If I shove 216 (13.5 BB), they need to call 200 and 184 respectively. They might fold medium hands.\n\nBetter to raise to 40-48 and fold to a 3-bet? But with my stack size, if I raise to 48 and get 3-bet, I'll have to fold, losing 48 chips (3 BB). That's significant.\n\nI think shoving might be best. Let me check if there are any hands where opponents called all-ins.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. But first, I should think about the hand. I'm on the button with KTo, 13.5 BB stack. Blinds are 8/16. Two players folded, SB and BB posted blinds. I need to call 16 to play. Minimum raise to 32. I have position being on the button. With KTo, it's a decent hand for late position, but not premium. At 13.5 BB, I'm getting short and should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. Being on the button is advantageous. I should consider raising to steal the blinds. The SB has 189 chips (11.8 BB), BB has 291 chips (18.2 BB). The BB has a bigger stack and might defend wider. But with my stack size, a raise to 32 (2x) would be committing about 15% of my stack. If I get called or raised, I'll have to play postflop with a marginal hand. Alternatively, I could just call and see a flop, but that's not great with KTo out of position against two players. Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I have position against both blinds. That's good. But calling with KTo multiway might not be great either. I should probably raise to try to take it down preflop. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have access to recall tools because I keep getting format errors. But based on general tournament strategy with 13.5 BB, KTo on the button is a standard raise/fold situation. I should raise to about 2.5x (40 chips) or 3x (48 chips). The minimum raise is 32, so raising to 40 is reasonable. If I get called, I'll have position and a decent hand. If I get shoved on, I might have to fold depending on stack sizes. The SB has 189, BB has 291. If either shoves, I'd have to call about 180 more chips if I raise to 40, which would be a big commitment. Actually, if I raise to 40 and SB shoves for 189 total, I'd have to call 149 more into a pot of about 269 (24+40+189). That's about 1.8:1 odds, needing about 35% equity. Against a shoving range of maybe 77+, AJ+, KQ, I have about 35% with KTo. It's close. But I'd rather not get into that spot. Maybe a smaller raise to 32 (min-raise) could work. But min-raises often get called more. I think standard play is to raise to 2.5x-3x and fold to a shove. With my stack, I could also consider shoving myself. But KTo might be a bit weak for a 13.5 BB shove from the button. Usually shoving ranges from button with 13.5 BB include hands like A2s+, A8o+, K9o+, QTo+, JTs, etc. KTo is probably in the lower end of that range. But shoving has the advantage of not facing difficult decisions postflop. However, if I shove for 216, the SB would have to call 208 into pot of 240 (24+216), needing about 46% equity. They might call with a decent range. BB would have to call 200 into 256, needing about 44%. They might call even wider. I think a raise/fold might be better. Let me check legal actions: I can fold, call, or raise. I think raising is best. I'll raise to 40 (2.5x). If I get shoved on, I'll likely fold unless I get a great price. Let me provide the JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the SB with Js Kd, stack 240 chips (15 BB). The action: I posted SB 8, BB posted 16, then seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 48 total, seat 1 folded, seat 2 raised to 118 total. Wait, seat 2 is listed as \"Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" but they raised? That seems odd - maybe they're all-in with 0? Actually seat 2 has 0 chips but raised to 118? That must be an error or they're all-in with their remaining stack. Let me check the pot: it's 190 chips. That includes: my SB 8, BB 16, seat 5 raise 48, seat 2 raise 118? Actually seat 2 raised to 118 total, meaning they put in 118 more than the BB? Let me reconstruct: BB is 16, seat 5 raised to 48 (32 more), seat 2 raised to 118 (70 more). So seat 2's raise is to 118 total.\n\nNow I need to call 110 more (total of 118). Minimum raise to 188 (70 more). My stack is 240, so I have 232 left after posting SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). They raised in hand 62 to 283. They also bet on turn in hand 57. Not much data.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 0 chips? Actually seat 2 shows 0 chips and is marked \"out\". Maybe they're all-in? If they have 0 chips, their raise might be all-in with whatever they had left.\n\nMy hand: KJo is decent but not premium from SB. Facing a raise and a re-raise. This is likely a fold situation. Pot odds: I need to call 110 to win pot of 190 + my call 110 = 300 total? Actually current pot is 190. If I call, pot becomes 300. So I'm getting 190:110 odds = 1.73:1, need about 36% equity.\n\nKJo vs likely ranges: seat 5 raised, seat 2 re-raised. Seat 2's range is probably strong: QQ+, AK maybe. Seat 5 might have medium pairs, broadways. KJo doesn't do well against these ranges, especially out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15 BB, which is short but not desperate. Folding leaves me with 232 chips (14.5 BB). That's still playable.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot than to commit half my stack with KJo out of position against a raise and re-raise.\n\nDecision: fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about this hand. I'm UTG with AJo, 15BB stack. Blinds are 8/16. I have 240 chips. There are 5 players at the table, but seat 2 has already folded. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the small blind, seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the big blind. I'm first to act.\n\nLooking at the opponent data for GPT-OSS-120B: They've been folding a lot preflop (7/10 times), but have raised twice: once to 283 (all-in presumably) and once to 48 (3x BB). The all-in raise was at hand #62, and the 48 raise was at hand #67. So they're fairly tight but capable of raising.\n\nMy hand AJo is decent but not premium from UTG. With a 15BB stack, this is in the push/fold range. Standard tournament strategy with 15BB: AJo from UTG is often a shove or fold decision. Let me think about the ICM implications.\n\nIf I raise, I'd be raising into 4 players left to act (SB, BB, and two others). With a 15BB stack, a standard raise commits me to the pot. If I raise to say 32-40 chips, and get re-raised, I'll be pot-committed anyway.\n\nBetter options:\n1. Fold: Conservative, preserve stack\n2. Call: Not great with AJo from UTG - invites multiway pots\n3. Raise: Standard\n4. All-in: With 15BB, this is reasonable\n\nGiven my stack size and position, I think shoving is reasonable. AJo is strong enough to shove 15BB from UTG. If I get called, I'll likely be ahead or flipping against smaller pairs.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The blinds are 8/16, so 15BB. If I shove 240, that's 15BB. The pot would be 24 (blinds) + 240 = 264, and someone would need to call 224 more (240 - 16 for BB or 240 - 8 for SB). That gives them pot odds of about 1.18:1, so they need ~46% equity. They'd need a decent hand to call.\n\nActually, let me think about the exact math. If I shove 240:\n- SB has 173 chips (10.8BB)\n- BB has 162 chips (10.1BB)\n- Others have similar stacks\n\nThey might call with a narrower range given their stack sizes.\n\nAlternative: raise to 40-48 (2.5-3x) and then fold to a shove? But with 15BB, if I raise to 48 (3x) and get shoved on, I'd have to call 192 more into a pot of... let's calculate: if SB or BB shoves over my raise, pot would be ~240+their stack+blinds. I'd be getting decent odds.\n\nActually, with 15BB, standard tournament strategy is to either shove or fold with most hands. AJo is definitely in the shoving range from UTG.\n\nLet me also consider the players behind: GPT-OSS-120B (SB) has shown some aggression but mostly folds. Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB) I don't have data on yet.\n\nI think shoving is the best play. It puts maximum pressure on the blinds and avoids playing postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 240,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AJo is a strong enough hand to shove 15BB from UTG in tournament play.

Wait, stack 0 chips but they raised 211? That seems odd. Let's parse: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). Probably eliminated but still in hand? Actually if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. Maybe they're all-in? The raise amount 211 seems huge relative to stacks. Let's think: my stack 216, Seat 4 stack 73, Seat 5 stack 0. Seat 5 raise 211 would be more than my stack. But maybe they're all-in with 211? But they have 0 chips? This is confusing.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Blinds 8/16. I'm SB, posted 8? Actually I'm seat 3 (SB). Seat 1 is UTG? Actually seat 1 is SB? Wait: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 154 chips (folded)\" but actions show \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 8\". So seat 1 posted SB? But I'm seat 3 and my position is SB. Maybe seat numbering is off? Let's read: \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". So I'm seat 3, SB. Seat 1 posted SB? That doesn't make sense. Maybe seat 1 is UTG? Actually typical 5-handed: seats: 1,2,3,4,5. I'm seat 3 SB. Seat 4 is BB? Wait: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 73 chips\" - maybe BB? But actions show \"preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 16\". So seat 2 is BB. So seat 1 is UTG? But they posted SB? Hmm.\n\nAnyway, action: I raised to 48 (from SB). Then Seat 4 raised to 100. Then Seat 5 raised to 211. Then Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold. Now action on me: amount to call: 163. Minimum raise to: 322. Legal actions: fold, call.\n\nPot is 383 chips currently. Let's calculate pot: SB 8, BB 16, my raise 48, Seat 4 raise to 100 (so added 52 more?), Seat 5 raise to 211 (added 111 more?). Actually need to compute total pot. Let's do stepwise:\n\nInitial: SB (seat 1) posts 8, BB (seat 2) posts 16. Pot = 24.\n\nI (seat 3) raise to 48. So I add 40 more (since SB already posted 8? Wait I'm SB, but seat 1 posted SB? Confusion. Actually I'm seat 3 SB, but seat 1 posted SB? Maybe seat 1 is actually SB? But description says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". Could be error. Let's assume I'm SB and I haven't posted yet? In typical poker, SB posts blind, then action. But here seat 1 posted SB, seat 2 posted BB. So maybe seat 1 is SB, seat 2 BB, I'm UTG? But my position says SB. Hmm.\n\nBetter to ignore confusion and focus on numbers: I have 216 chips. Amount to call is 163. If I call, I'll have 53 chips left. Pot after my call would be 383 + 163 = 546 chips. Then Seat 4 has 73 chips total, they have already put in 100? Wait they raised to 100, but they started with 73 chips? That can't be. If they have 73 chips, they can't raise to 100. Maybe they're all-in? Actually they have 73 chips, so their raise to 100 is effectively all-in for 73? But the raise amount is 100 total. They might be all-in for 73. Similarly, Seat 5 has 0 chips, so their raise to 211 is all-in for whatever they have? But they have 0 chips, maybe they're already all-in from previous hand? Actually \"out\" means eliminated from tournament, but maybe they're still in hand because they haven't folded?

Let me analyze without tools for now.\n\nI have pocket Tens, facing a re-raise and then a shove. The situation is confusing due to stack sizes and positions. But key facts:\n- My stack: 216 chips\n- Amount to call: 163 chips\n- If I call, I'll have 53 chips left\n- Pot after my call: 383 + 163 = 546 chips\n- I'm getting pot odds: need to call 163 to win 546, which is about 1:3.35, or need ~23% equity.\n\nWith pocket Tens, against ranges that include re-raises and shoves, my equity might be marginal. Seat 4 has only 73 chips, so they're likely all-in or nearly all-in. Seat 5 has 0 chips but raised to 211 - this is weird; maybe they're all-in from previous hand? Actually \"out\" means eliminated, so maybe they're not in the hand? But they raised... This is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should consider tournament situation: I have 13.5 BB. Pocket Tens is a strong hand. Folding would leave me with 216 chips (13.5 BB). Calling could potentially triple up or bust.\n\nLet me think about ranges:\n- Seat 4 (73 chips) raised to 100: likely strong hand, maybe pairs 88+, AJ+, maybe wider since short stack.\n- Seat 5 (0 chips) raised to 211: if they're actually all-in, they might have a very strong range (JJ+, AK).\n\nMy Tens might be behind. But pot odds are decent. However, if I call and lose, I'm down to 53 chips (3.3 BB), which is desperate. If I fold, I still have 13.5 BB, which is playable.\n\nGiven the confusion about seat positions and stacks, and the fact that I'm getting decent pot odds but risk being dominated, I should probably call. Pocket Tens is too strong to fold for 163 into 383 pot, especially with only 13.5 BB effective stack.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that Seat 4 has only 73 chips, so their effective stack is 73. Seat 5 has 0 chips? Actually if Seat 5 has 0 chips, their raise is meaningless; they can't have chips. Maybe they're all-in from antes? Not sure.\n\nLet me assume Seat 5 is all-in for some amount. The pot is 383. If I call 163, I'm all-in effectively (leaving 53 chips). Then Seat 4 calls with 73 total? They already put in 100? Wait they have 73 total, so they can't put in 100. This is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, I think the safe play is to call. Tens are strong, and I'm getting good pot odds.

That seems odd since they only have 8 chips. Let me check the action again: Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16. Seat 4 and 5 folded, Seat 1 folded. Then Seat 2 raised 166. But they only have 8 chips total. Wait, maybe the raise amount is the total they're putting in? Or maybe they're all-in? Let me think: They posted SB 8, then raised 166 total? That would mean they're putting in 166 total, but they only have 8 chips. That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at the data: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. They have 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, so they're all-in with their 8 chips. But the action says \"raise 166\". That might be a display issue. Maybe \"raise 166\" means they're raising to 166 total? But they only have 8 chips. Let me check the amount to call: 150. Minimum raise to: 316. That seems like there's already 182 in the pot. Wait, pot is 182 chips. Blinds 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. That's 24. Others folded. So pot should be 24. But pot is 182? That seems wrong. Maybe there are antes? Or maybe there's a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate: Blinds 8/16. SB posts 8, BB posts 16. That's 24. Seat 2 raised 166. If they're raising to 166 total, they're putting in 166 - 8 = 158 more. But they only have 8 chips total. So they can't raise that much. Maybe the raise amount is the additional amount? \"raise 166\" could mean they raise by 166, making total bet 174? Still doesn't make sense with 8 chips.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 is actually Kimi-K2 with 8 chips, and they're all-in for their remaining 8? But the action says \"raise 166\". Could be a bug. Let me look at the amount to call: 150. That seems huge relative to my stack of 37. I need to call 150 to win... what? Pot is 182 currently. If I call, I put in 150, making pot 332. But I only have 37 chips total. I can't call 150 because I don't have that many chips. I'm only required to call up to my stack size, right? In poker, you can only be forced to call up to your remaining stack. So if someone raises more than my stack, I can call all-in for my remaining chips.\n\nMy stack: 37 chips. I already posted BB 16, so I have 21 left. The amount to call is 150, but I only have 21. So I can call all-in for 21 more. That makes sense. So the raise is effectively putting me all-in.\n\nThus, I need to decide whether to call all-in with 4c 3d. Pot odds: I need to call 21 to win pot of 182 + 21 = 203? Let's calculate: Current pot is 182. Opponent has put in 8 (SB) + raised? Actually, they have 8 chips total, all-in. So they've put in 8. I've put in 16. Others folded. So pot should be 8+16=24. But pot is 182. That's weird. Maybe there are antes or something. Or maybe the pot includes the raise amount? Let's think: If opponent raised to 166 total, but only has 8 chips, the effective raise is 8. So the pot would be: SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's all-in 8 = 32. But pot is 182. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe the pot display includes the raise amount? Or maybe there are multiple players? Let me re-read: Players at table: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 8 chips, Seat 3 is me with 37, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 folded. So only two players active: me and Seat 2.\n\nMaybe the pot of 182 includes the raise amount of 166? That would mean the pot is 166 + 16 = 182. That makes sense: Opponent raised to 166 total, putting in 166. But they only have 8 chips. So maybe"

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. My hand is 4c 3d, extremely weak. I'm in BB with 37 chips (2.3 BB). Opponent in SB has only 8 chips total. They raised to 166, which is more than their stack, so they're effectively all-in for their 8 chips. The amount to call is 150, but I only have 21 chips left after posting BB. So I can call all-in for 21 more chips.\n\nPot calculation: SB posted 8, I posted 16. Opponent is all-in for 8 total, so they've put in 8. I've put in 16. Pot should be 24. But pot shows 182. That suggests maybe there are antes or the pot includes the raise amount incorrectly. Regardless, I'm getting pot odds: I need to call 21 to win whatever is in the pot. If pot is truly 182, then I'm getting 182:21 odds, which is about 8.7:1. That's huge. But 4c 3d is a terrible hand, only 23% equity against a random hand. Actually, 43o has about 38% equity against a random hand? Let me think: 43o vs random has around 38% equity preflop. Against a typical raising range from SB, maybe 25-30%. But opponent only has 8 chips and is desperate, so their range could be very wide.\n\nLooking at opponent history: In hand 67, they raised to 118 preflop. They seem aggressive when they have chips. Now they have only 8 chips, so they're likely shoving with any two cards. My 43o has decent equity against a random hand - about 38%. With pot odds of 8.7:1, I only need about 10% equity to call. 38% is way above that.\n\nBut wait, there's something odd about the pot size. Let me check hand 67 from opponent history: they raised to 118. That was when they had more chips. Now they have 8 chips. The pot size of 182 seems wrong for just SB vs BB. Maybe the display includes the raise amount in the pot? If opponent raised to 166, and I've put in 16, pot would be 166+16=182. But opponent only has 8 chips, so they can't raise to 166. Unless... maybe the \"raise 166\" means they're raising all-in, and 166 is the total pot size? No.\n\nActually, looking at the data: \"Amount to call: 150\" and \"Minimum raise to: 316\". If opponent raised to 166 total, then the amount to call would be 166 - 16 = 150. That makes sense. Minimum raise would be to 166 + 150 = 316. So opponent raised to 166 total. But they only have 8 chips. This is contradictory. Unless the stack display is wrong, or opponent actually has more chips than shown.\n\nLet me think about tournament situation: I have 37 chips (2.3 BB). That's critically short. Opponent has 8 chips (0.5 BB). We're both very short. In tournament poker, when both players are this short, you should call with a very wide range because you're getting good pot odds and need to accumulate chips. With 2.3 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. Here, opponent has shoved (effectively). I need to decide whether to call.\n\nWith 43o, it's a marginal hand. But against a desperate opponent with 0.5 BB, they could be shoving any two cards. My equity against any two cards is about 38%. Pot odds: I need to call 21 to win pot. Let's calculate actual pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's all-in 8 = 32. If I call 21 more, total pot becomes 53. I'm investing 21 to win 32, so pot odds are 32:21 or 1.52:1. I need 39.7% equity to break even. 43o has about 38% against random hand. So it's close to break-even.\n\nBut if the pot is actually larger (182 as shown), then odds are much better. Given the display inconsistency, I should assume the actual pot is smaller. However, in tournament with both players very short, I should probably call. Folding leaves me with 21 chips (1.3 BB). Calling and winning gives me 37+8=45 chips (2.8 BB). Calling and losing eliminates me.\n\nGiven my equity and the situation, it's a close decision. But with such short stacks, I should take the gamble. The opponent is desperate and likely shoving wide. My hand has some potential to"

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. My hand is 4c 3d, extremely weak. I'm in BB with 37 chips (2.3 BB). Opponent in SB has only 8 chips total. They raised to 166, which is more than their stack, so they're effectively all-in for their 8 chips. The amount to call is 150, but I only have 21 chips left after posting BB. So I can call all-in for 21 more chips.\n\nPot calculation: SB posted 8, I posted 16. Opponent is all-in for 8 total, so they've put in 8. I've put in 16. Pot should be 24. But pot shows 182. That suggests maybe there are antes or the pot includes the raise amount incorrectly. Regardless, I'm getting pot odds: I need to call 21 to win whatever is in the pot. If pot is truly 182, then I'm getting 182:21 odds, which is about 8.7:1. That's huge. But 4c 3d is a terrible hand, only 23% equity against a random hand. Actually, 43o has about 38% equity against a random hand? Let me think: 43o vs random has around 38% equity preflop. Against a typical raising range from SB, maybe 25-30%. But opponent only has 8 chips and is desperate, so their range could be very wide.\n\nLooking at opponent history: In hand 67, they raised to 118 preflop. They seem aggressive when they have chips. Now they have only 8 chips, so they're likely shoving with any two cards. My 43o has decent equity against a random hand - about 38%. With pot odds of 8.7:1, I only need about 10% equity to call. 38% is way above that.\n\nBut wait, there's something odd about the pot size. Let me check hand 67 from opponent history: they raised to 118. That was when they had more chips. Now they have 8 chips. The pot size of 182 seems wrong for just SB vs BB. Maybe the display includes the raise amount in the pot? If opponent raised to 166, and I've put in 16, pot would be 166+16=182. But opponent only has 8 chips, so they can't raise to 166. Unless... maybe the \"raise 166\" means they're raising all-in, and 166 is the total pot size? No.\n\nActually, looking at the data: \"Amount to call: 150\" and \"Minimum raise to: 316\". If opponent raised to 166 total, then the amount to call would be 166 - 16 = 150. That makes sense. Minimum raise would be to 166 + 150 = 316. So opponent raised to 166 total. But they only have 8 chips. This is contradictory. Unless the stack display is wrong, or opponent actually has more chips than shown.\n\nLet me think about tournament situation: I have 37 chips (2.3 BB). That's critically short. Opponent has 8 chips (0.5 BB). We're both very short. In tournament poker, when both players are this short, you should call with a very wide range because you're getting good pot odds and need to accumulate chips. With 2.3 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. Here, opponent has shoved (effectively). I need to decide whether to call.\n\nWith 43o, it's a marginal hand. But against a desperate opponent with 0.5 BB, they could be shoving any two cards. My equity against any two cards is about 38%. Pot odds: I need to call 21 to win pot. Let's calculate actual pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's all-in 8 = 32. If I call 21 more, total pot becomes 53. I'm investing 21 to win 32, so pot odds are 32:21 or 1.52:1. I need 39.7% equity to break even. 43o has about 38% against random hand. So it's close to break-even.\n\nBut if the pot is actually larger (182 as shown), then odds are much better. Given the display inconsistency, I should assume the actual pot is smaller. However, in tournament with both players very short, I should probably call. Folding leaves me with 21 chips (1.3 BB). Calling and winning gives me 37+8=45 chips (2.8 BB). Calling and losing eliminates me.\n\nGiven my equity and the situation, it's a close decision. But with such short stacks, I should take the gamble. The opponent is desperate and likely shoving wide. My hand has some potential to",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with JSON. Let me make a decision. I'm in BB with 43o, stack 37 chips. Opponent in SB has 8 chips and raised to 166 total, which is more than their stack, so they're effectively all-in for 8 chips. I need to call 150, but I only have 21 left. So I can call all-in for 21.\n\nThe pot size seems inconsistent, but based on standard poker: SB posted 8, I posted 16, opponent all-in for 8 total. Pot = 32. I need to call 21 more. Pot odds: 32:21 = 1.52:1, requiring 39.7% equity. 43o has ~38% vs random. Slightly -EV if opponent is truly random. But opponent is desperate with 0.5 BB, likely shoving any two. It's very close.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 2.3 BB, opponent 0.5 BB. If I fold, I have 21 chips (1.3 BB) and will be in SB next hand with 8 chips, then BB with 16. Basically doomed. If I call and win, I double up to ~45 chips (2.8 BB). Still short but better. If I lose, I'm out.\n\nGiven the dire situation, I should take the gamble. The equity is close to break-even, and folding leaves me almost dead anyway. I'll call.\n\nAction: call (all-in).

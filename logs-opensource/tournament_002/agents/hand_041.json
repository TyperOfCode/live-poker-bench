That's pot odds of 12:8 or 1.5:1. I need 40% equity to justify a call.\n\nWith 93o against random hands, I have about 35-40% equity, but:\n1. The SB has shown they can raise with decent hands\n2. The BB has been extremely tight, folding everything recently\n3. My hand has almost no playability postflop - no suitedness, no connectivity, low cards\n4. Even if I hit a 9, I'm often dominated by better 9s\n5. If I hit a 3, it's almost never good\n\nGiven the BB's extreme tightness (folding 10 hands in a row), there's a chance they might defend their blind here, but it's unlikely. The SB could have a wide range but has shown they can raise.\n\nWith my weak hand and the need to preserve my 20BB stack in a tournament, this is a clear fold. The position advantage doesn't compensate for such a weak holding. I should wait for better spots, especially given that I have enough chips to be patient.\n\nI could consider a steal raise since the BB is so tight, but:\n- The SB has shown they can raise/call\n- 93o is too weak to raise with\n- If I raise and get called, I'll be in a tough spot postflop\n- My stack isn't deep enough to make speculative plays like this profitable\n\nDecision: FOLD",

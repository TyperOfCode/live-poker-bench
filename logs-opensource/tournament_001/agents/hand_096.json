            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 4s Qc (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 481 chips (15.0 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 32\n- Minimum raise: 64\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q4 offsuit is a very weak hand. Not connected, not suited, and the Q is dominated by many hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 15 BB, which is in the \"short stack\" territory. At this stack depth, I should be playing very tight and looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands is generally bad with a short stack.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - SB has 222 chips (6.9 BB) - very short\n   - BB has 184 chips (5.75 BB) - very short\n   - Two players are already out\n\n5. **Tournament Consideration**: With 15 BB, I need to be selective. The SB and BB are both very short and might bust soon. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48, which is 1.5:1 odds. This would require 40% equity to be profitable. Q4o doesn't have that against any reasonable range.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. Q4o is just too weak to play, especially with a short stack. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot (like when the blinds are even shorter and I can pressure them).\n\nI don't need to recall any opponent actions here - this is a straightforward fold based on hand strength and stack size.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the big blind with 5c 3s, a very weak hand. My stack is 184 chips (5.8 BB). The small blind (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips total and has raised 222, which is effectively an all-in since they only had 16 chips? Wait, let me check: Seat 2 posted SB of 16, so they had 16 chips total. They raised 222, but that's impossible since they only have 16 chips. Actually, looking at the data: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they have 0 left? But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 222\". That seems like a mistake or they're all-in for their remaining stack? Let me think: SB is 16, BB is 32. Seat 2 posted SB 16, so they have 0 chips left. Then they \"raise 222\" - maybe it's showing the total amount they put in? Actually, they can't raise more than they have. Perhaps the 222 is the total pot size? Let me recalculate.\n\nPot: 254 chips. That includes: SB 16, BB 32, and Seat 2 raised to 222 total? Wait, \"Seat 2 raise 222\" likely means they raised to 222 total (including their SB). So they put in 206 more (222 - 16 = 206). But they only have 16 chips total, so that can't be right.\n\nMaybe the chip counts are wrong. Let me read carefully: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. That's their stack size. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in with their 16 chips. The \"raise 222\" might be a display error. Actually, amount to call: 190. Minimum raise to: 412. That suggests the current bet to call is 190 chips. The pot is 254 chips. If SB posted 16 and BB posted 32, that's 48. Then SB raised... to make total pot 254? Let's calculate: 48 + raise amount = 254. So raise amount = 206. That means SB raised by 206, making their total contribution 16 + 206 = 222. But they only have 16 chips, so they can't raise 206 more. Something is off.\n\nMaybe Seat 2 actually has more chips than shown? Or maybe the 16 chips is after posting SB? Actually, they posted SB 16, so their stack might be 0 now. But the display shows 16 chips as their stack. Could be they started with 16, posted SB 16, now have 0, but the display hasn't updated. The raise 222 is likely the total amount they've put in (all-in for their remaining 0?).\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand Kimi-K2's behavior. Also search for similar situations.",

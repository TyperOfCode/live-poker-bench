            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand #8: folded preflop\n- Hand #9: raised to 4, then raised to 28, then called 30, then raised 100 on flop, bet 50 on turn (this was a very aggressive sequence)\n- Hands #10-13: folded preflop every time\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 has been mostly folding preflop, but when they do raise, they can be quite aggressive. The small raise to 4 chips (2x the big blind) from a stack of 42 chips suggests this might be a standard opening, but could also be a weak hand trying to steal.\n\nMy hand: 5d 7c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. Even in position this would be a fold, and I'm out of position in the BB.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so 3.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 57o is just too weak.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 367 chips (183.5 BB), so no pressure to gamble.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can be aggressive post-flop (Hand #9), so even if I hit something like a pair of 5s or 7s, I could be easily dominated.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is an easy fold with a trash hand out of position.",

From UTG, this is typically a fold in most poker strategies.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (worst position at the table) - We'll have to act first on all postflop streets, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack**: 256 chips (128 BB) - We have a deep stack, so no immediate pressure to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 367 chips - Seems aggressive based on past hands (raised in hand 8, 9, 11)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 46 chips - Very short stack (23 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 147 chips\n\n5. **Action so far**: Only blinds posted, Seat 2 folded. We're first to act.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 128 BB, we can afford to be patient and wait for better spots. J8s from UTG is marginal at best.\n\nLooking at past hands:\n- I've folded from UTG position twice before (hand 5 and 10) with weak hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown aggression\n- MiniMax-M2 is very short and might be looking to push\n\nPoker strategy considerations:\n- J8s from UTG is a clear fold in most tournament strategies\n- Even if we call, we'll likely face raises from later positions\n- Suited connectors need good implied odds, but from UTG with deep stacks behind, we could get raised and have to fold\n- The pot odds are 3:2 (calling 2 to win 3), but we need much better implied odds for this hand\n\nDecision: **Fold**. This hand is too weak from UTG position. Better to wait for a stronger hand in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Js 8s is too weak from UTG position.

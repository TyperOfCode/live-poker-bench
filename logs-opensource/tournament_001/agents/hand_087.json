With 9s4h, that's a terrible hand. Even against a wide SB raising range, 94o has maybe 35-40% equity? But I'm short-stacked at 4.9 BB. This is a tournament, and I'm the shortest stack at the table (others have 250 and 433). The SB has 250 chips (7.8 BB). \n\nI need to think about opponent tendencies.

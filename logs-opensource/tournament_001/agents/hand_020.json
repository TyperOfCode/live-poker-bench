Everyone has folded to me, and the big blind (Kimi-K2 with 181 chips) has posted the big blind of 2 chips.\n\nI need to pay 1 more chip to call. The pot is currently 3 chips (1 from my small blind + 2 from the big blind).\n\nLooking at the opponent's actions from the recall:\n- They've been very tight, folding most hands (hands 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19)\n- When they do play, they tend to raise (hands 1, 7, 16, 17)\n- In hand 1 they raised to 18 chips preflop, then folded (presumably to a re-raise)\n- In hands 7, 16, 17 they raised to 6 chips\n\nSo the BB is a tight player who raises with strong hands. This is relevant because:\n1. If I just call, they might raise and I'd have to respond\n2. If I raise, they might fold or 3-bet\n\nWith pocket tens on the button, this is a premium hand. I should raise for value. Standard raise sizing would be 3x the big blind, so 6 chips total (to 6). This is also the minimum raise amount shown in the legal actions.\n\nGiven the opponent is tight, they might fold weaker hands but could 3-bet with premium hands. If they 3-bet, I can re-evaluate. With my deep stack (183 BB), I can comfortably play postflop with tens.\n\nI should raise to 6 chips (3x BB).",

Even though the call is only 2 chips, I'm essentially committing to play a weak hand that will be difficult to play profitably postflop. The risk of being raised off my hand is high, and even if I see a flop, A4o rarely improves to a strong enough hand to win.\n\nThis is a clear fold situation.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4o is too weak to play from UTG position, especially with players left to act who could have stronger hands.

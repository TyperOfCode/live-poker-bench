It's suited but not connected (gap of 3 cards)\n- It's a \"trouble hand\" - often dominated by better tens or dominated by overcards\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, last to act post-flop\n**Stack**: 191 chips (95.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 1/2\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**Amount to call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Based on history, they've been folding a lot (folded in hands 3, 4, 5), called once, and raised once then folded. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - More aggressive, has raised multiple times (hands 1, 3), but also folded recently (hands 4, 5). Mixed strategy.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak. 7-T offsuit is not a strong starting hand. It's easily dominated by T-J, T-Q, T-K, T-A, and any pair.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with a weak hand like this, position advantage is limited unless we hit a very specific flop.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: We're getting 1.5:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 3). This is not great for a hand this weak.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - SB seems to be playing somewhat tight recently (folded 3 out of last 4 hands)\n   - BB is more aggressive but has also folded recently\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 95.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. I should preserve my chips for better situations.\n\n6. **Implied odds**: Very low. If I hit a T, I could be dominated. If I hit a 7, it's rarely good. The only good scenario is hitting two pair or a straight, which is very unlikely.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This hand is too weak to play from any position, even on the button. The pot odds aren't good enough, and we risk being dominated even when we hit. Let's wait for a better spot.",

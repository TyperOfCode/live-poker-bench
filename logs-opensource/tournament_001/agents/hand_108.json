            "content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Qc6d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 535 total, which is a massive overbet - they started with only 32 chips (the SB) and are essentially going all-in with their remaining 503 chips (since they posted 32 SB, they have 503 more to make it 535 total). Actually, wait: seat 2 had 32 chips total? No, looking at the player list: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". That means they only had 32 chips total, and they posted SB of 32, so they're all-in with 0 left. Actually, they raised 535, but they only have 32 chips? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". And \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 32\". So they posted 32 as SB, leaving them with 0 chips. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 535\". How can they raise 535 if they only had 32 total? This must be a tournament situation where they're all-in. The raise amount of 535 is probably the total bet size including their SB, but they only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at the pot: \"Pot: 599 chips\". Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64. So pot should be 32+64=96. But pot is 599. That includes the raise. So opponent raised to 535 total, which is 503 more than the SB of 32. But they only have 32 chips? This is confusing.\n\nActually, maybe the chip count display is wrong, or they have more chips than shown. Let me think: If opponent has only 32 chips, they'd be all-in with any raise. The raise to 535 would be impossible unless they have at least 535 chips. So likely the chip count \"32 chips\" is incorrect or means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call. I have Q6o, which is terrible. The pot is 599, and I need to call 471. That's pot odds of 599:471, or about 1.27:1, meaning I need about 44% equity to call. Q6o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some loose hands: Q7o, K7s, K2o, 88, etc. They raise sometimes preflop. But still, Q6o is terrible.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). If I fold, I'll have 272 chips. If I call and lose, I'm out. If I call and win, I'll have about 272 + 599 = 871 chips? Actually, my stack is 272, I need to call 471 but I only have 272 total. So I'm all-in if I call. The amount to call is 471, but I only have 272 total, so I can only call my remaining 208? Wait, I have 272 total. I already posted BB of 64, so I have 208 left. I need to call 471 more, but I only have 208, so I'm all-in for my remaining 208. The pot would be: SB 32 + my BB 64 + my all-in 208 + opponent's raise? Actually, opponent raised to 535 total, which includes their SB 32, so they put in 503 more. But they might have me covered.\n\nActually, let me calculate: I have 272 total. I put in BB of 64, leaving 208. Opponent raised to 535 total from SB. The amount to call is 471 (535 - 64). But I only have 208 left, so I can only call 208. So effectively we're both all-in if I call.\n\nPot if I call: My 272 + opponent's 535? Actually, opponent's 535 includes their SB 32, so total from opponent is 535. From me: 272 total. Pot = 272 + 535 = 807 chips.\n\nMy equity needed: risk 208 to win 599? Actually, pot before my call is 599. I need to call 208. Pot odds: 599:208 = 2.88:1, meaning I need about 26% equity. That's better.\n\nBut still, Q6o vs likely raising range has maybe 30% against a very wide range? Let's estimate: Against top 50% of hands, Q6o has about 35% equity."

Wait, that doesn't make sense - they only have 32 chips total according to the player list. Let me check the actions again: Seat 2 post_sb 32, then Seat 2 raise 535. But they only have 32 chips. This must be an all-in situation where they're putting in their remaining 32 chips? Actually, the amount to call is 471, which suggests the bet is 535 total. But if they only have 32 chips, they can't bet 535. Maybe the player list shows 32 chips but they actually have more? Or maybe seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 32 chips, and they're going all-in for their last 32? But the amount to call is 471, which would be 535 total minus my 64 BB already posted.\n\nWait, I need to think: I posted BB of 64. Seat 2 posted SB of 32. Then seat 2 raised to 535 total. If they only have 32 chips, they can only go all-in for 32. Something's off. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\" but then \"Seat 2 raise 535\". That can't be right unless there's a display error.\n\nActually, looking at the pot size: 599 chips. That's 32 (SB) + 64 (BB) + 535 (raise) = 631, not 599. Hmm.\n\nLet me calculate: If seat 2 has 32 chips total, they can only put in 32. So their raise would be an all-in for 32 total. Then the amount to call would be 0? No, I need to figure this out.\n\nBetter to check opponent tendencies first. Let me use the recall tool.",

The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 535 total, which is a massive overbet - they started with only 32 chips (the SB) and are essentially going all-in with their remaining 503 chips (since they posted 32 SB, they have 503 more to make it 535 total). Actually, wait: seat 2 had 32 chips total? No, looking at the player list: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". That means they only had 32 chips total, and they posted SB of 32, so they're all-in with 0 left. Actually, they raised 535, but they only have 32 chips? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". And \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 32\". So they posted 32 as SB, leaving them with 0 chips. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 535\". How can they raise 535 if they only had 32 total? This must be a tournament situation where they're all-in. The raise amount of 535 is probably the total bet size including their SB, but they only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at the pot: \"Pot: 599 chips\". Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64. So pot should be 32+64=96. But pot is 599. That includes the raise. So opponent raised to 535 total, which is 503 more than the SB of 32. But they only have 32 chips? This is confusing.\n\nActually, maybe the chip count display is wrong, or they have more chips than shown. Let me think: If opponent has only 32 chips, they'd be all-in with any raise. The raise to 535 would be impossible unless they have at least 535 chips. So likely the chip count \"32 chips\" is incorrect or means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call. I have Q6o, which is terrible. The pot is 599, and I need to call 471. That's pot odds of 599:471, or about 1.27:1, meaning I need about 44% equity to call. Q6o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some loose hands: Q7o, K7s, K2o, 88, etc. They raise sometimes preflop. But still, Q6o is terrible.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). If I fold, I'll have 272 chips. If I call and lose, I'm out. If I call and win, I'll have about 272 + 599 = 871 chips? Actually, my stack is 272, I need to call 471 but I only have 272 total. So I'm all-in if I call. The amount to call is 471, but I only have 272 total, so I can only call my remaining 208? Wait, I have 272 total. I already posted BB of 64, so I have 208 left. I need to call 471 more, but I only have 208, so I'm all-in for my remaining 208.

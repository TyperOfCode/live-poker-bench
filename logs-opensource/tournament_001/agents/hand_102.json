I need to be very selective with my hands at this stack depth.\n\nLooking at my recent hand history, I've been folding a lot in the last few hands (hands 98-101), which is consistent with my overall very tight play (77 folds out of 101 hands, only 23% win rate).\n\nLooking at Seat 2's actions, I can see they've been raising frequently preflop (hands 90, 94, 96, 99, 100) with amounts ranging from 222 to 318. This suggests an aggressive player who likes to steal blinds.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm on the Button, the best position\n- I have Qs 6c - a very weak hand, offsuit and not connected\n- My stack is 417 chips (6.5 BB) - very short\n- Pot is 96 chips\n- I need to call 64 chips\n- The small blind (Seat 2) and big blind (Seat 3) are the only players left\n\nWith a 6.5 BB stack, I should be looking for spots to shove all-in with decent hands. However, Q6o is a terrible hand even for a shove. \n\nThe pot odds are 96:64 or 1.5:1, which means I need ~40% equity to call. Q6o typically has much less equity against any reasonable range.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should preserve my chips for a better spot. Q6o is simply not strong enough to call or raise here, even with position.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand or situation.",

            "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 3h5h, which is a very weak hand. My stack is only 56 chips (0.9 BB), so I'm essentially all-in with any call. The pot is 192 chips, and I need to call 64 chips. However, I only have 56 chips total, and I've already posted 64 as the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". This seems contradictory - if I have 56 chips, how can I post 64 as BB? Maybe the 56 is after posting? Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 (SB) posted 32, I posted 64 as BB, then Seat 2 raised 128. So total pot is 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? But it says pot is 192 chips. Let me calculate: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 128 = 224. But maybe the raise amount includes the SB? Seat 2 had to call 32 more to match BB, then raise additional 96? Actually standard: SB posts 32, BB posts 64. Then SB can raise. Minimum raise would be to 128 total (64 + 64). Seat 2 raised 128, which is exactly double the BB. So total pot: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise amount 128 = 224. But display says 192. Maybe the 128 is total amount Seat 2 put in? That would be: SB 32 + additional 96 to make 128 total. Then pot = 64 (BB) + 128 (SB total) = 192. Yes that makes sense: Seat 2 put in 128 total (32 SB + 96 raise). So I need to call 64 more to match the 128 total.\n\nBut I only have 56 chips total. Actually wait: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\". That must be after posting the BB? If I started with 120 chips, posted 64 BB, I'd have 56 left. So I have 56 chips behind, and need to call 64 more. I can only call 56 (all-in). So effectively I'm all-in if I call.\n\nNow, opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently based on history: hand 96 raised 222, 99 raised 270, 100 raised 318. Seems aggressive. My hand 3h5h is terrible, but I'm getting pot odds. Let me calculate: If I call all-in for 56 chips, total pot will be: current 192 + my 56 = 248 chips. I need to put in 56 to win 248, so need ~22.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a random hand, 3h5h has about 38% equity. Even against a tight range like top 20%, it has ~32%. So pot odds justify a call with any two cards given I'm so short. But wait, I'm in a tournament. With 0.9 BB, I'm basically dead anyway. Folding leaves me with 56 chips (0.9 BB) which is essentially zero - I'll be all-in next hand in SB anyway. So I should call with any two cards.\n\nBut let me check if there's any ICM considerations. It's a tournament, but with 0.9 BB, I have no fold equity. Calling gives me a chance to double up to ~1.8 BB, still short but better than 0.9 BB.\n\nActually, wait: If I fold, I have 56 chips. Next hand I'll be SB (32) and BB (64). I'll have to post 32 SB, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB. Actually the blinds are 32/64, so I'd have to post 32 as SB next hand, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB if someone raises. But I might get a walk if everyone folds. Still, very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and tournament situation, I should call. Even with 3h5h, it's better than folding to have a chance.\n\nBut let me think about opponent's range. From showdowns: they showed 44, 5K, KK, TQ, 2K. Mixed range. They're raising frequently. Could be wide.\n\nDecision: Call all-in. Since I can't afford the full 64, I'll be all-in for my remaining 56.\n\nAction: call (which puts me all-in).\n\nResponse JSON: {\"action\": \"call\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Stack is 0.9 BB, pot odds justify call with any"

Let me check: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". That seems contradictory. If I have 56 chips and posted BB of 64, I'd be all-in. But maybe the stack is after posting? Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" - that's my current stack. Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64, so I had 120 chips before posting? Actually if I have 56 chips now, and I posted 64, that means I started with 120 chips? That doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is before posting? Let me think: I'm in BB, so I posted 64. My stack shows 56 chips. That means I have 56 chips left after posting the BB? But 56 + 64 = 120, which would be 1.875 BB. Hmm.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\". Seat 2 (SB) posted SB 32, then raised to 128 total. So they put in 32 + 96 raise = 128 total. I need to call 64 more (since I already put in 64 as BB). My stack is 56 chips, so I can only call 56 more? Actually I have 56 chips total, not 56 chips to call. I need to understand my exact chip situation.\n\nLet me check: \"Amount to call: 64\". That means I need to put in 64 more chips. But my stack is only 56 chips. So I can only call 56, which would be all-in. But the interface says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". It doesn't say \"all-in\" but calling would put me all-in since I have less than the call amount.\n\nThis is a tournament situation. I have 0.9 BB effectively. With 3h5h suited, it's a very weak hand. But I'm in the BB, already invested 64 chips. The pot is 192 chips (SB 32 + my BB 64 + raise 96 = 192). I need to call 64 more, but I only have 56 chips. So I'd be all-in for 56 chips.\n\nPot odds: If I call 56, the pot will be 192 + 56 = 248 chips. I'm getting about 4.4:1 pot odds (248:56). That's decent.\n\nBut hand strength: 3h5h is weak, but suited connectors can have some equity. Against a typical SB raising range, what's my equity? Let me think: SB raised from the small blind after everyone folded. Their range could be wide since they're stealing. They might have any two cards.\n\nGiven I have only 0.9 BB left, this is basically a mandatory call. I'm getting good pot odds, and I'm so short stacked that I should take any chance to double up. Even with 3h5h, I have some equity against random cards.\n\nBut let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\". Let me recall their actions.",

Actually: SB posted 32, BB posted 64, opponent raised 128 total which includes his SB? Wait, let's calculate: SB posted 32, I posted 64, opponent raised to 128 total. So opponent put in 128, which is 96 more than his SB. So pot = 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? No, that can't be right. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\" - this is the total amount he put in. He already posted SB 32, so additional 96. So total pot = SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 96 = 192. Yes.\n- I need to call 64 more chips (but I only have 56 total stack, so I'm all-in for my remaining stack)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 raises frequently preflop (222, 222, 222, 270, 318 raises seen).

Pot odds: I need to call 56 chips (my whole stack) to win 192 + 56 = 248 chips? Actually, pot is 192, opponent has bet 128 total (96 more than SB). If I call, I put in 56 more, pot becomes 192 + 56 = 248. I get 248:56 odds, about 4.4:1.\n\nWith 3h5h suited, against a wide raising range, I have decent equity. Suited connectors can hit flushes, straights. Even against a premium hand like AK, I have ~30% equity. Against a wider range, better.\n\nTournament situation: I have 0.9 BB, basically desperate. If I fold, I'll have 56 chips (0.9 BB) next hand in SB, forced to post 32, leaving 24 chips (0.375 BB). Very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and stack situation, calling is correct.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 3h5h, which is a very weak hand. My stack is only 56 chips (0.9 BB), so I'm essentially all-in with any call. The pot is 192 chips, and I need to call 64 chips. However, I only have 56 chips total, and I've already posted 64 as the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". This seems contradictory - if I have 56 chips, how can I post 64 as BB? Maybe the 56 is after posting? Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 (SB) posted 32, I posted 64 as BB, then Seat 2 raised 128. So total pot is 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? But it says pot is 192 chips. Let me calculate: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 128 = 224. But maybe the raise amount includes the SB? Seat 2 had to call 32 more to match BB, then raise additional 96? Actually standard: SB posts 32, BB posts 64. Then SB can raise. Minimum raise would be to 128 total (64 + 64). Seat 2 raised 128, which is exactly double the BB. So total pot: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise amount 128 = 224. But display says 192. Maybe the 128 is total amount Seat 2 put in? That would be: SB 32 + additional 96 to make 128 total. Then pot = 64 (BB) + 128 (SB total) = 192. Yes that makes sense: Seat 2 put in 128 total (32 SB + 96 raise). So I need to call 64 more to match the 128 total.\n\nBut I only have 56 chips total. Actually wait: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\". That must be after posting the BB? If I started with 120 chips, posted 64 BB, I'd have 56 left. So I have 56 chips behind, and need to call 64 more. I can only call 56 (all-in). So effectively I'm all-in if I call.\n\nNow, opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently based on history: hand 96 raised 222, 99 raised 270, 100 raised 318. Seems aggressive. My hand 3h5h is terrible, but I'm getting pot odds. Let me calculate: If I call all-in for 56 chips, total pot will be: current 192 + my 56 = 248 chips. I need to put in 56 to win 248, so need ~22.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a random hand, 3h5h has about 38% equity. Even against a tight range like top 20%, it has ~32%. So pot odds justify a call with any two cards given I'm so short. But wait, I'm in a tournament. With 0.9 BB, I'm basically dead anyway. Folding leaves me with 56 chips (0.9 BB) which is essentially zero - I'll be all-in next hand in SB anyway. So I should call with any two cards.\n\nBut let me check if there's any ICM considerations. It's a tournament, but with 0.9 BB, I have no fold equity. Calling gives me a chance to double up to ~1.8 BB, still short but better than 0.9 BB.\n\nActually, wait: If I fold, I have 56 chips. Next hand I'll be SB (32) and BB (64). I'll have to post 32 SB, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB. Actually the blinds are 32/64, so I'd have to post 32 as SB next hand, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB if someone raises. But I might get a walk if everyone folds. Still, very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and tournament situation, I should call. Even with 3h5h, it's better than folding to have a chance.\n\nBut let me think about opponent's range. From showdowns: they showed 44, 5K, KK, TQ, 2K. Mixed range. They're raising frequently. Could be wide.\n\nDecision: Call all-in. Since I can't afford the full 64, I'll be all-in for my remaining 56.\n\nAction: call (which puts me all-in).\n\nResponse JSON: {\"action\": \"call\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Stack is 0.9 BB, pot odds justify call with any",

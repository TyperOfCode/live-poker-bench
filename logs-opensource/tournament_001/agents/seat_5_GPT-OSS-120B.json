Actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4 (so 2bb). Then we (Seat5) raised to 12 (so 6bb). Then seat4 re-raised to 20 (so 10bb total). So we are facing a 8 chip call (20-12). Minimum raise to 28 (i.e., raise at least to 28 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Consider opponent MiniMax-M2's behavior unknown. Use recall? Already attempted, no data. Could search observations for MiniMax-M2? Probably none. So we must decide based on typical ranges. Preflop 3-bet to 12 from BB vs open-raise of 4 from MP (seat4). Then opponent 4-bet to 20. This is a 4-bet. Our hand QsKs is decent but not premium for 4-bet. Typically 4-bet range includes TT+, AK, maybe AQ suited sometimes. QK suited is borderline; could be a 4-bet bluff or call. In tournament, stack 93 BB deep, can afford to call and see flop. But also risk losing many chips. The pot after opponent's 4-bet is 34 (current) + 8 call = 42? Actually pot currently 34 includes blinds and initial raise? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, MP raise to 4 (adds 2), we raise to 12 (adds 10), opponent re-raise to 20 (adds 8). So pot now 1+2+4+12+20 = 39? Wait each player's contribution: SB 1, BB 2, MP 4, us 12, opponent 20 = total 39. The amount to call is 8 (20-12). So pot before call is 39-8 =31?

Actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4 (so 2bb). Then we (Seat5) raised to 12 (so 6bb). Then seat4 re-raised to 20 (so 10bb total). So we are facing a 8 chip call (20-12). Minimum raise to 28 (i.e., raise at least to 28 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Consider opponent MiniMax-M2's behavior unknown. Use recall? Already attempted, no data. Could search observations for MiniMax-M2? Probably none. So we must decide based on typical ranges. Preflop 3-bet to 12 from BB vs open-raise of 4 from MP (seat4). Then opponent 4-bet to 20. This is a 4-bet. Our hand QsKs is decent but not premium for 4-bet. Typically 4-bet range includes TT+, AK, maybe AQ suited sometimes. QK suited is borderline; could be a 4-bet bluff or call. In tournament, stack 93 BB deep, can afford to call and see flop. But also risk losing many chips. The pot after opponent's 4-bet is 34 (current) + 8 call = 42? Actually pot currently 34 includes blinds and initial raise? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, MP raise to 4 (adds 2), we raise to 12 (adds 10), opponent re-raise to 20 (adds 8). So pot now 1+2+4+12+20 = 39? Wait each player's contribution: SB 1, BB 2, MP 4, us 12, opponent 20 = total 39. The amount to call is 8 (20-12). So pot before call is 39-8 =31? Actually pot before we act includes our 12 and opponent's 20? The pot currently includes our 12 already, but we haven't added extra 8. So pot = 1+2+4+12+20 =39. If we call 8, pot becomes 47.

Actually actions: Seat4 raise 4 (UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2). Then Seat5 raise 12 (re-raise). Seat1 folds. Seat4 raise 20 (3-bet). Seat5 call 8 (call to 20). So pot 42 includes blinds etc. Now flop: Jh Jd 4c. So we have QsKs, no pair, no draw. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised preflop, likely a strong range (maybe broadway, pairs). On flop, opponent likely continuation bet? But amount to call is 0, meaning opponent checked? Wait actions: amount to call 0, so we have option to check or raise. So opponent (MiniMax) must have checked. So board: double Jacks, 4c. Our hand QK, overcards. No flush draw (two clubs on board? Actually 4c is club, we have Qs Ks, both spades and hearts? Qs, Ks, both spades? Actually Qs is spade, Ks spade. So no club. So no flush draw. Straight draw? J-4, we have K Q, could make straight if 10 and 9? Actually need 10 and 9 for straight with J J 4? Not possible. So just overcards.\n\nWe need to decide check or raise. Consider opponent's range: preflop they raised to 4 (open), then 3-bet to 20 after our re-raise. They are likely strong: maybe AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe suited connectors. On flop double Jacks, they likely have Jacks, maybe overpair (AA, KK, QQ), or AK/AQ etc. They checked, maybe they missed, or they have a hand like AK that wants to see turn. We have QK, which is overcards, but no pair. If we bet, we could represent a jack? But we have no jack. Could we bluff? Could be effective if opponent folds weaker hands like AQ? Actually AQ would have Q, but they'd have top pair with queen kicker? Wait board J J 4, AQ has queen, not a pair. So they'd have overcards. So they'd likely fold to a bet if they have weak overcards. But also they might have Jacks, they'd call. So risk.\n\nWe have a fairly deep stack (89 BB). Pot 42. A raise could be maybe 2-3x pot? That would be about 84-126 chips. That might pressure. But if they have Jacks they'd call. If they have overpair they'd maybe call as well. So we risk losing many chips. Maybe better to check and see turn.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB but flop is after opponent checked, we are first to act? Actually we are BB, opponent is seat4 (UTG?) They are left of us? The action order is from left of button? In flop, the first active player to the left of the button acts first. The button is seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB? Wait seat1 is SB? Actually preflop: Seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat4 is UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, they opened raise preflop. So flop action order: seat4 (UTG) is first, then seat5 (SB). Since seat4 checked, seat5 acts next. So we are out of position (first to act after opponent). So raising is a bluff, but we are out of position, which is less effective.\n\nThus best to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\nReasoning: we have no pair, only overcards, opponent likely strong, check to preserve.\n\n",

Pot after flop: preflop pot 2 (bb) + raise 4+12+20+8? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 4 (seat4), raise to 12 (seat5), raise to 20 (seat4), call 8 (seat5). So after preflop, pot: SB 1+BB 2+4+12+20+8 = 47? Actually need to sum contributions: seat4 put 4 then 20 (total 24). seat5 put 1 (sb) +12 +8 =21. seat1 put 2 (bb). So pot = 2+1+24+21 =48? Wait double-check: SB is seat5 posted 1, BB seat1 posted 2. Then seat4 raise to 4 (so adds 2 more beyond 2? Actually big blind is 2, seat4 raise to 4 means he puts 4 total, so net contribution 4). Then seat5 raise to 12 (adds 11 more beyond 1). Then seat1 folds. Then seat4 raise to 20 (adds 16 more). Then seat5 call 8 (adds 8 more). So total contributions: seat4: 4+16 =20? Wait raise to 20 means total 20, not add 16? He already had 4 in, so adds 16. So seat4 total =20. seat5 total = 1+11+8 =20. seat1 =2. So pot =20+20+2 =42. But the given pot before flop is 78 after flop betting? Actually after flop, pot is 78 chips. Flop: seat5 check (no bet), seat4 bet 18, seat5 call 18. So pot adds 36 to previous 42 =78. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2s. Pot 78, we have Qs Ks. Opponent's range likely includes strong Jacks (set), two pair, maybe overpairs like AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe draws? He bet 18 on flop, we called, so he might have a made hand or a draw. Turn card is 2s, which likely doesn't help many draws except maybe a gutshot? Not relevant.\n\nOur hand is likely losing. We could check or fold. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we check and hope river? Likely we should just check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising is not good.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn scenario. Our hand: Qs Ks. Board: Jh Jd 4c 2s. So we have QK with no pair, we have a gutshot? Actually board has J J 4 2. We have overcards, but also possible straight draws? Board: J J 4 2. Our hand Q K. Potential: we have a backdoor straight draw? Not really. We have two overcards, could make top pair if a Jack hits, but we already have two Jacks on board, so any Jack would give opponent a set if they have J. But we have no pair. Our hand currently is just high cards, no pair, no draw. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 18 on turn after we checked. Pot currently 96+18+18 (flop bet and call) = 132? Let's compute: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, then raise to 4 (MiniMax) then raise to 12 (us) then raise to 20 (MiniMax) then call 8 (us) = contributions: seat4: 4 + 20 = 24? Actually seat4 raise 4 (initial) then later raise to 20 (i.e., added 16 more) total 20? Wait: preflop: seat4 raise 4 (so puts 4). seat5 raise 12 (so puts 12). seat1 fold. seat4 raise 20 (so total 20). seat5 call 8 (so puts additional 8 to match 20). So contributions: seat4: 20, seat5: 12+8=20. plus blinds: seat5 posted small blind 1, seat1 posted big blind 2. So total pot after preflop: 20+20+1+2 = 43? But also seat5 posted SB 1 earlier, but then raised 12 (including the 1? Usually raise to 12 means total 12, so additional 11). But we can approximate pot after preflop maybe 43. Flop: seat5 check (0), seat4 bet 18, seat5 call 18. So pot adds 36, total pot 79. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 18. So pot before turn bet: 79. After bet 18, pot becomes 97. The amount to call is 18, making total pot after call 115. So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely opponent has something like a set (J), two pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a made hand. We have no showdown value. Should we fold? Probably yes. But we need to consider stack depth: we have 160 chips, opponent 141. Bet 18 is about 11% of our stack. Could we bluff? Probably not with QK, not strong enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall turn actions of MiniMax-M2. The tool returned none (no data). So we have no info. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 called the BB from CO? Actually seat 4 is CO (since BTN seat5, seat4 is CO). They just called. They may be playing a wide range from CO. K3 is okay to raise? Might be okay to raise for value and isolation. But we have relatively deep stack (80 BB) and can open raise to 4 (2x BB). Typically open raise 2.5-3 BB. So raising to 4 is fine. However we need to consider that they already called. We are in position, can either raise or call. Raising could isolate and get folds from later players (none left). Only SB and BB are already in pot. SB already posted 1, BB 2, and CO called 2. So raising may get them to call more. SB might fold or call. BB might call or raise. K3 is not a strong hand for a 3-bet; but a raise from BTN is standard open, not a 3-bet. So it's okay to raise to 4. The pot after raise would be 5 + 4 (our raise) = 9? Actually current pot 5 (SB1+BB2+CO2). If we raise to 4 total, we add 2 more chips (since we need to call 2 then raise 2 more). So new pot 7? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, CO 2, we put 4 total (so we add 4). So total pot = 1+2+2+4 =9. Yes.\n\nCalling just adds 2, making pot 7. K3 has some equity but not great vs unknown range. Raising may fold SB and BB if they are tight. Could also get a call from them, building pot. Considering tournament early stage? Stack 80 BB, still deep. Might want to preserve chips, but also accumulate. K3 is not a hand to risk too much; but raising to 4 is low risk.\n\nCheck is not allowed because amount to call is 2.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: we are BTN with 3d Kh. Board: 9d Qh 5d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with King high, plus backdoor straight possibilities? Not really. Also we have gutshot? 3d Kh gives us king high, no pair. We have a flush draw (4 outs to make flush? Actually we have two diamonds (3d) and board has two diamonds (9d,5d) so we have 4 diamonds total, need one more diamond to make flush. There are 13 diamonds total, 4 known, so 9 outs. Also we have an overcard King to board (Q,9,5). Potential for top pair if a K hits? Not on board. So currently we have 0 pair, but we have a backdoor straight? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 is on the button? Actually they are seat 4, which is CO? Seats: 1 SB, 2 BB, 3 (?), 4 is MiniMax-M2, 5 is us. So seat 4 is likely cutoff (CO). Preflop: they called 2 after we raised to 4, so they have a hand that can call a 2BB raise. They could have a wide range: suited connectors, broadways, etc.\n\nFlop: they bet 2 into pot 13. That's a small bet (about 1/3 pot). Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) with a wide range, possibly also a draw, or a weak hand. They might be trying to see cheap. Our hand: flush draw with overcards. Pot odds: call 2 to win 13+2 = 15 pot? Actually pot currently 13, they bet 2, so total pot after call = 13+2+2 = 17? Wait: pot before flop bet = 13. They bet 2, so if we call, we add 2, making pot 15? Let's calculate: preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus our raise 4 and their call 2? Actually preflop: SB 1, BB 2, we raise to 4 (so we put 4, they already posted 2, need 2 more), they call 2, they put total 4? Wait: preflop actions: Seat1 post_sb 1, Seat2 post_bb 2, Seat3 fold, Seat4 call 2 (so they call the raise, they put 2 more to match our 4? Actually raise to 4 means total 4, they had posted 2, need 2 more, they call 2). Seat5 raise 4 (we raise to 4, we put 4). Seat1 fold, Seat2 fold, Seat4 call 2 (they call our raise). So preflop contributions: SB 1, BB 2, us 4, them 4 (2 call + 2 call). Total pot = 1+2+4+4 = 11? But given pot is 13. Maybe includes antes? Not relevant. Anyway pot is 13, they bet 2, so pot after bet = 15, call 2 makes pot 17. So calling 2 gives us 2 to win 15 (pot before call). So pot odds = 2/15 \u2248 13.3%, we need about 13% equity. Our flush draw has about 9 outs, plus maybe some combos for pair? Actually we also have overcard King, could pair on turn or river. So total outs maybe ~12? Approx equity ~ (outs*2)/100 = 18% on turn, plus additional on river ~? So we have >13% equity, so call is profitable.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., total 4). That would be a raise of 2 extra beyond call? Actually they bet 2, raise to 4 means add 2 more. That would be a small raise, maybe to protect or to build pot. But raising could be risky if they have strong hand and re-raise. Our hand is not strong enough to raise for value. Could raise as semi-bluff to fold out better hands? Their bet is small; raising may just get called and we risk more chips.\n\nGiven we have a decent draw and pot odds are good, best is call.\n\nCheck stack: 156 chips, 78 BB, we can afford call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BTN with 3d Kh (King high, 3 of diamonds). Board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. So after turn, board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. Turn card is? Not specified; board shows 4 cards: 9d Qh 5d 8c. The turn is 8c (since flop had 9d Qh 5d, turn 8c). So board now: 9d Qh 5d 8c. We have King of hearts and 3 of diamonds. Our hand: currently a gutshot? We have a straight draw? Let's see possible straight: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have Q on board, need J and K? We have K, missing J and 10. Not a straight yet. Also we have a flush draw? Board has two diamonds (9d,5d) and we have 3d, so three diamonds total. Need two more diamonds for flush, not there yet. So currently we have high card K, maybe pair? No. So we have nothing, just K high.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) is in seat 4, has been playing. Preflop they called 2 (small blind?), they are in BB? Actually seat 2 is BB, seat 4 called 2 preflop (so they were in SB? Wait seat 1 posted sb 1, seat 2 posted bb 2. Seat 4 call 2: that suggests they were in UTG? Actually they called big blind? But they are not in blind, they just called 2. So they have a random hand.\n\nFlop: board 9d Qh 5d. Opponent bet 2 (small). We called 2. So they are continuing aggression.\n\nTurn: opponent bet 2 again (small). We need to decide.\n\nOur stack 154, pot 17, opponent bet 2, so pot after call would be 19. We have K high, no draw. Likely fold.\n\nBut consider tournament situation: 77 BB, opponent 229 chips, we have 154. We could consider a bluff raise? Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4). That's a raise of 2 more chips. Could attempt a steal? But we are out of position? Actually we are BTN, we are in position (acting after them). They bet 2, we could raise to 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). That would be a small raise. But with K high, maybe we can bluff as they may have missed the turn. However they bet again, suggests they have something or are bluffing. Could be a draw or made hand. Our K high is weak.\n\nGiven pot odds: To call 2 to win 17 (plus opponent's 2?), pot is 17, they bet 2 making pot 19, call 2 wins 19. So pot odds 2/19 ~10.5%, good. But we have no equity; we would only call if we think we have some chance to improve on river (maybe a straight draw?). After turn, board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. We have Kh 3d. Potential outs: Straight draw? Let's check: we could have a straight with 7-6? Actually board: 5-8-9-Q. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 6 and 7). Not possible. 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7,10,J). Not. 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10,J). We have K, not. 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 10,J). So we have K, but need 10 and J. Not many outs. Flush draw: we have 3d, board has 9d,5d. Need two more diamonds on river, impossible (only one card left). So no outs. So we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have UTG with As Js. Stack 151, blinds 1/2, effective stacks about 75 BB. Opponents: seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2 (249 chips), seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (47 chips) is short stack, seat 1 Kimi-K2 Thinking (369), seat 2 Kimi-K2 (180). Preflop: seat 3 posted small blind 1, seat 4 posted big blind 2. So we are first to act UTG (seat5). Amount to call 2, min raise to 4.\n\nWe need to decide: raise or call? Call would just call 2 (i.e., limp) which is rarely good UTG with AJ suited. Raise is standard. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 short stack (47 chips) may be willing to shove or call all-in. Their raise patterns: they raised to 4 (min) in hand 4 and 9, also raised larger amounts 20,28. So they are aggressive. As we raise, they may either call or shove all-in. But we have decent stack. Raising to 4 (i.e., 2 raise) is small; maybe we should raise to 6 (standard 3x BB) or 8? Minimum raise to 4 is only 2 more chips. But typical raise size is 3-4 BB, i.e., 6-8 chips. Since we have deep stack, we can raise to maybe 8. Legal actions allow raise to any amount up to stack. We should raise to 8 (total). Reason: open-raise with AJ suited from UTG is strong, want to build pot and isolate, also protect against being raised all-in later.

Need to consider opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG likely strong: maybe 66+, AQs+, etc. Could include 7x combos? 7-8 suited could be in range but less likely. On flop with 7c, they likely have top pair (9s) or overpairs (TT+, maybe 99? Actually board 7c 9h 5s, overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA would be ahead of our pair. They could also have 9x, 79, 78, 67, 56 draws. Our pair 7s is second pair. Might be behind many. But we have backdoor flush and gutshot. Pot is 13, we have 148 stack. Should we check to see opponent's action? If we bet, we might get called by better hands, losing value. Checking may give us free card, but also allow opponent to bet and we may be forced to call with marginal hand. Considering we are out of position (BB vs UTG), maybe check. But we have a decent hand (pair of 7s) but board is relatively dry. Could we check-raise? Not allowed because opponent hasn't bet. So we can either bet small to protect against draws? There are potential straight draws like 6-8, 6-7, 8-6, but not many. Might be okay to bet 4 (about 1/3 pot) to get value from worse hands (like 6-6, 5-6, 8-5, etc.) and protect. Opponent's range includes maybe 66, 55 (but 55 is set? Actually board has 5s, so 55 would be set, they'd bet). 66 would be overpair, they'd likely bet. So betting may get called by better, losing. Checking might induce opponent to bet with worse (like a draw) and we can call. But we risk giving free card.\n\nGiven tournament, we have a medium stack, but not short. I'd likely check and see what opponent does. So action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6 (so total 6+1+2? Actually raise to 6 means put 6 total, so extra 4 from UTG plus 1 from SB and 2 from BB? But anyway pot 28 given). He bets 15. We have 148 stack, effective stack ~ 148-? we have 148 total, we put 2 BB preflop, call 4, now 15 to call. So decision: call, raise, or fold.\n\nHand strength: Pair of sevens, top pair? Board: 7c 9h 5s. Opponent may have 9x, 7x, 5x, maybe straight draws like 6-8, 8-10, etc. Our 7d8d gives us pair and open-ended? Actually we have 7 and 8, board 7,9,5. So we have pair of sevens, plus we have 8 gives us gutshot to 6-10? Wait need 6 for straight: 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight, we have 7 and 8, board 5,9, need 6 to complete. So gutshot. Also we have backdoor flush draw (diamonds) but board has no diamond. So limited.\n\nOpponent bet 15, about half pot (pot 28). So pot odds: need 15 to win pot of 43 (28+15). So odds ~ 35% needed. Our equity vs random? Probably less. But we need to consider opponent's range: Preflop raise from UTG likely strong: maybe 77+, AJs+, KQs, etc. Could also be suited connectors. On flop 7c9h5s, he bets. He could have 9x, 7x, 5x, overpairs, AK, etc. Our hand is likely second best unless he missed. We have pair of sevens, but board also has 7, so we have top pair? Could be if opponent doesn't have a 7. But opponent could have 9, overpair, etc. So calling is risky.\n\nWe have stack 148, can we raise? Minimum raise to 30 (so raise to 30). That would be a raise of 15 more. Could be a semi-bluff? With gutshot and backdoor flush, but not great. Might fold.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have 74 BB, decent stack, but not huge.

Our stack 145 chips, deep. Position BB, out of position post-flop.\n\nHand Q2 suited is very weak, especially off-suit? Actually suited: both spades, so Q\u26602\u2660. Potential for flush draws, but still low equity. Preflop against a raise, typical action: fold unless you have a reason to call (maybe to defend blind with suited connectors). Q2 suited is not a good defender, especially against a raise from UTG? Not sure where seat 3 is relative to us. Seats: seat 1 (folded), seat 2 (folded), seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised, seat 4 (folded), seat 5 (us). So seat 3 is UTG? Actually we are seat 5 (BB). Seats 1-4 are before us. So seat 3 is the third player to act preflop, after seat 2. So seat 3 is probably \"UTG+1\"? The blinds: seat 4 posted SB, seat 5 posted BB. So seat 1 is under the gun? Actually seat 1 is first to act preflop (UTG). So seat 3 is \"MP\"? Let's map: 8 seats maybe but only 5 seats active? Actually there are 5 seats total. Seat order: 1 (UTG), 2 (UTG+1), 3 (UTG+2?), 4 (SB), 5 (BB). So seat 3 is \"cutoff\"? Not exactly. With 5 players, positions: seat 1 is UTG, seat 2 is MP, seat 3 is CO (cutoff), seat 4 is SB, seat 5 is BB. So DeepSeek-V3.2 is in cutoff. Their raise of 6 is a standard raise. They could be raising wide or tight. Past data: they've raised 6 in two previous hands (hand 3 and 13) and once raised 45 (hand 1). So they sometimes raise big, sometimes small. No other info.\n\nOur hand Q2s is not a good call. The pot odds: need to call 4 to win 9+4=13 pot. So pot odds ~ 4/13 \u2248 30.8%. Our equity vs unknown range is far lower, maybe ~10% or less. So folding is correct.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe need JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

In BB, you can limp (call) and see flop cheap. But with 72 BB, we can afford to limp. However, consider opponent seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) in seat 1 is the SB? Actually seat 1 posted SB 1, seat 5 posted BB. So opponent in SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 367 chips (large stack). SB may raise often. But they have already posted SB and not yet acted. It's preflop, after SB posted 1, BB posted 2, now it's SB's turn? Actually order: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then action starts with player left of BB, which is SB (seat 1). So SB's action hasn't occurred yet. The actions list shows only posting, no raises. So it's SB's turn to act, amount to call is 1 (i.e., they need to call the BB's 2? Wait amount to call is 1 meaning they need to put in 1 more to match BB? Actually from BB perspective, amount to call is 1 because they already posted 2, SB posted 1, so to call SB's raise they'd need to call 1? No, SB hasn't acted. In BB, amount to call is the difference between the current bet (SB's bet) and BB's bet. Since SB hasn't bet, the current bet is 1 (SB's blind). BB already put 2, so to call SB they need to put in 0? Actually typical: after blinds, action starts with player after BB. If SB checks (i.e., does not raise), BB can check (i.e., no additional chips). But the system says amount to call: 1. That suggests they consider BB's effective amount to call is 1 to call the SB's blind (i.e., to match the 1). But BB already has 2 in, which is more than SB's 1, so they are already ahead. Usually BB can check. So amount to call 1 seems odd. Possibly the system treats BB's perspective: need to call 1 more to bring total to 3? Not sure. But they gave legal actions: fold, call, raise. So calling would put in 1 chip more, making total 3? That would be a \"check\" effectively? Actually if BB calls 1, they'd be putting 3 total, which is 1 more than SB's 1, so they'd be raising? Not correct.\n\nNevertheless, typical decision: with 9h5h, we can either call (i.e., just check) or raise. Raising is not advisable with such a weak hand. So we likely will call (i.e., just check). So action: call? Or check? Since amount to call is 1, we call. Reason: weak suited, deep stack, want to see flop cheap.\n\nThus output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #21 preflop. Position BB, Ad9h (Ace of diamonds, 9 hearts). Stack 139 chips (~34.8 BB). Blinds 2/4, so big blind 4.\n\nAction: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) posted small blind 2, Seat3 posted big blind 4 (but seat3 is folded? Actually seat3 posted BB 4, then later seat3 fold). Seat4 folded. Seat5 (us) raise to 8 (so we opened 4 over BB? Actually we are BB, we raise to 8 (i.e., 4 more). Then seat1 fold. Seat2 raise to 24 (so they re-raise to 24). Seat3 fold.\n\nNow we face a raise to 24, we have already put 8, so amount to call 16 (to match 24). Minimum raise to 40 (so raise total to 40). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand Ad9h offsuit. In BB vs SB re-raise. SB is Kimi-K2. We have some data: Kimi-K2's raise amounts: 18 (hand1), 6,6,6. So they have raised small amounts often (6) maybe wide range. But they also raised 18 once. Not a lot of data. Our hand is Ace-9 offsuit, decent but not premium. In BB vs SB 3-bet, typical ranges: SB's 3-bet range maybe wide, but with 34 BB we can consider call or fold. Stack depth moderate. 24 is 6 BB (since big blind 4, 24/4=6 BB). That's a sizable 3-bet.\n\nOur hand Ad9 offsuit is about 8%? Actually A9 offsuit is around 12% vs random. In BB vs SB 3-bet, it's marginal. Usually you would fold A9o unless you have good implied odds or you think opponent is loose. Our stack is 34 BB, not huge but enough.\n\nWe also have pot 36 (blinds+our raise). If we call 16, pot will be 36+16+16? Actually after SB raises to 24, pot = 36 (original) + 24 (SB) + 8 (our raise) = 68? Wait timeline: Preflop: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, pot = 6. We raise to 8 (total), so we put 4 extra (since we already have 4). So we add 4, pot = 10. SB folds? Actually seat1 fold, SB raise to 24, adding 22 more (since they already put 2). So pot becomes 10 + 22 = 32? Wait compute: Starting pot after blinds = 6. Our raise to 8: we add 4 (so total contributed by us = 8). Pot = 6 + 4 = 10. SB raise to 24: they add 22 (since already 2). Pot = 10 + 22 = 32. Then we need to call 16 to match 24 (we have 8 already). So if we call, we add 16, pot = 48. So calling gives us 48 pot for 16 call = 3:1 pot odds, 33% needed. Our hand equity vs unknown range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline.\n\nGiven limited data, maybe fold. Also we have 34 BB, preserving stack is important. I'd likely fold A9o to a 3-bet from SB.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

It's a decent hand, but against a short stack who may be stealing, we could call and see flop, but risk being out of position post-flop (we'll be out of position after flop? Actually we are BTN, after flop we will be in position relative to them). So calling is okay.\n\nPot odds: need to call 8 to win pot 14+8=22? Actually pot currently 14 (SB+BB) plus raise 8 = 22?

So no straight. Flush draw? Two hearts on board, we have none, so no flush. Pair? We have Ace high, no pair. So hand is weak. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised preflop to 8 (from SB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 34 chips, likely short stack). He is short stack 34 chips, 8 raise is 2/4 blinds? Actually blinds 2/4, so raise to 8 is 2x big blind. He has 34 chips, about 8.5 BB. He is short; could be shoving soon. He bet 4 on flop (half pot). Pot now 30, bet 4, we can call 4. Our stack 125, so we can call. Need evaluate opponent tendencies: short stack may be trying to steal, maybe has overpair like AA, KK, or suited connectors. Board has Ace, so if he has Ace, he'd have top pair, maybe bet. Could be bluff? He raised preflop from SB with 34 chips; maybe he had a wide range (any pair, suited connectors, A-x). He called our call preflop (we called his raise). So he is willing to see flop. On flop he checks, we check? Actually seat 2 (BB) checks, then seat 4 (MiniMax) bets 4. So we need to decide call, raise, fold.\n\nGiven hand is weak, likely fold. But consider pot odds: pot 30, bet 4, we need to call 4 to win 34 (pot+bet). Pot odds ~ 4/34 = 11.8% needed. Our equity with Ace high vs unknown short stack range? Likely low. So folding is correct.\n\nBut maybe we could raise as a bluff? Our stack 125, we could raise to 8 min, but opponent short stack might call all-in? He only has 34 chips left, after bet 4 he has 30 left. If we raise to 8, he could call 4 more (to 8 total) maybe all-in? Actually min raise to 8 means total bet 8, so raise additional 4, making total bet 8. He would need to call 4 more (from 30 left) to 8. He could call and still have chips left. Raising could be a bluff, but we have weak hand and short stack may have strong. Probably fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

In a tournament early-ish with 30 BB, UTG raising is possible but many players would fold. However 8K is not a premium hand; many players would fold to a raise. Could also consider calling the big blind (4) to see flop cheap. But position is early, risk of being out of position.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: we have two players left: Seat2 posted SB (2) and Seat3 posted BB (4). Actually seat2 is SB with 2 chips? Wait SB is 2, they posted 2 chips, seat3 is BB posted 4 chips. So we are facing a raise? No, we are facing amount to call 4 (the BB). So it's preflop, it's our turn, we can call 4 to see flop. The legal actions are fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 119, others have 357,241,268. So we have shortest stack.\n\nRaising with 8K could be a steal attempt, but being UTG is not a steal; the blinds are small relative to stack. If we raise to minimum 8 (i.e., total 8 chips), that's a raise of 4 over BB. That would be a 2x BB raise. Not a big raise. Might get called by both SB and BB.\n\nGiven our hand is not strong, maybe we should fold. But we also have a short stack; we may need to pick spots to pick up chips.\n\nWe could call and see flop cheaply, hoping to hit a straight or pair. 8K is decent but not great.\n\nI think best is to fold preflop.\n\nBut we could also consider calling to see flop and maybe steal later. However being out of position UTG, postflop play is tough.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Qh5h, suited queen and 5. In BTN, facing SB 2, BB 4. Action: SB posted 2, BB posted 4. No raises yet. It's our turn, amount to call 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Stack 119, 29.8 BB. Hand is weak: Q5 suited is not great, but in BTN you could open raise to steal blinds. However opponents: seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB) and seat2 Kimi-K2 (BB) are same name? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2. Both have some raise tendencies. From recall: Kimi-K2 preflop raises amounts: 6, 12, 18, 24. So they raise sometimes small amounts (3BB) or larger. They may be aggressive. As BB they posted 4; they could be defending. As SB they posted 2; they may be passive? Not sure.\n\nOur hand is not strong enough to call and see flop for cheap, but could raise to steal. However Q5 suited can make flush, but low equity vs 2 opponents. In BTN with 30 BB, you can open raise to about 2.5-3 BB (10-12 chips). Minimum raise is 8 (2BB). We could raise to 12 to apply pressure. But risk: if they both call or raise, we might be in trouble. But we have position, can fold if re-raised.\n\nGiven hand marginal, typical strategy: raise to about 2.5 BB (10 chips) to steal. If they call, we can see flop with decent position. If they raise, we can fold.\n\nThus action: raise to 10? Minimum raise is 8; raise to 10 is allowed? Yes raise to any amount >= min raise. So choose raise_to 10.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So they likely have a range: maybe broadway, suited connectors, etc. On flop they haven't acted yet (we are BB, they are in seat 2 UTG? Actually seat 2 is after seat1 folded, seat2 raised preflop. Now flop, it's seat2's turn first (since they were preflop raiser). The pot is 26 chips (2+4+12+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 2 (seat3), BB 4, raise to 12 (seat2) means they put 12 total? Actually raise to 12 means they added 8 more after BB 4. So total contributions: seat3 2, seat5 4, seat2 12, seat5 called 8? Wait seat5 called 8 (the raise amount is 12, they need to call 8 more). So seat5 contributed 4+8 =12. So total pot after preflop: seat3 2, seat5 12, seat2 12 = 26. Yes pot 26.\n\nNow flop Qc5d4d, no action yet. We have 113 chips left. Opponent stack 219.

If they bet, we can consider calling if pot odds favorable? Pot 26, bet maybe 12-20. Our pair of sixes is likely behind many hands: Qx, 5x, 4x, straight draws, flush draws (diamonds). So not good. So best to check and likely fold if they bet.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8 (meaning raise to 8? Actually raise to total 8? But we already have 0 to call. Minimum raise to 8 means we can raise to 8 total? That would be a raise of 8 chips. That's small. Could consider a small raise as a bluff?

Better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

We need to decide fold/call/raise. AJ suited is a strong hand, especially in short stack. Effective stack: opponent's stack unknown? Opponent seat 3 has 272 chips. Our stack 111, so we are short stack relative to them. We are in SB, so after posting 2, we face 8 to call, min raise to 16 (i.e., raise additional 6). Considering tournament, we have 27.8 BB, we can either call and see flop, or raise all-in? Our stack 111 chips, raise to 111 would be all-in. Minimum raise to 16 is small relative to our stack, but a raise might isolate. With AJ suited, we could raise to maybe 30-40 to apply pressure. However we are short stack; calling 8 leaves us 103 left, still decent. But if we call and lose, we lose 8, still have 103. Might be okay. However we have AJ suited, a premium hand. Raising could get more value if they have a weaker hand, but they already raised to 10, maybe they have a wide range. In SB, we can also consider re-raising all-in to leverage fold equity. Opponent's raise size 10 is small; they may be opening a wide range from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, position unknown but likely UTG? Table seats: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 (BB), seat 2 folded, seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 5 is us (SB). So DeepSeek is UTG (or early). Their raise size is 10 (2.5 BB). That suggests a standard raise. With AJ suited, we can either call or 3-bet. Our stack 111, we could 3-bet to maybe 30-40 to isolate. But risk of being 4-bet all-in? Opponent could 4-bet all-in, but they have 272 chips, can cover us. However they might not 4-bet with weaker hands.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 27.8 BB, not extremely short but can afford a push. AJ suited is a good hand to go all-in in short stack. Many players would push with AJ suited at 28 BB. So I think push all-in (raise to 111). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to our stack (all-in). Reasoning: maximize fold equity, avoid playing postflop with short stack, strong hand.\n\nThus action: raise to 111.",

In BB vs raise from UTG? Actually seat2 is likely UTG? Not sure. But we are BB, only opponent in hand (others folded). So it's a heads-up pot. In heads-up, range is wide. 3bb raise from opponent, we can call with many hands. T6s is marginal. Considering stack depth 30 BB, we can call.\n\nWe might also consider raising (3-bet) to isolate. But T6s is not a strong 3-bet candidate; 3-bet range typically strong like AQs, AK, etc. So likely call.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 often raises 12 preflop (hand #31, #35, #36). So they are raising 12 often, maybe wide. They also sometimes bet on flop with 8, 18, etc. Not much info. So we can call.\n\nPot odds: To call 8 into pot 18+8 = 26 after call? Actually current pot 18, opponent raised to 12, so pot now 18+12 = 30? Wait initial pot 18 includes blinds 2+4+? Actually blinds 2+4 =6, plus maybe antes? Not. So pot 18 before raise? The pot includes SB 2, BB 4, plus maybe other? Actually they listed pot 18 chips. Then opponent raises to 12 (adds 8 more). So pot now 18+8 =26? Let's compute: Starting pot 6, after raise to 12, opponent adds 8, pot 14. But they list pot 18 maybe includes something else. Not crucial. Call 8 for pot ~26, odds ~30%? So need equity >30% to be profitable. T6s vs unknown raise range maybe around 30%? Might be okay.\n\nThus call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: Jc As Jd (pair of Jacks, Ace high). Our hand: Ts 6s (Ten of spades, Six of spades). So we have a gutshot? Actually board: J J A. We have Ten spade, which gives us a straight draw? No, need QK? Not. We have a backdoor flush possibility (spades: board has no spade). So we have nothing: just high card Ten, not a pair. So we are currently with a weak hand.\n\nPot is 26 chips. Our stack 115, we have 115 total, but we already put 4 (bb) + call 8 = 12? Actually preflop we called 8 (big blind 4 + call 8? Wait: raise to 12 by seat 2, we called 8 to match 12 (since we already have 4 in blind). So we have 12 in pot? The pot after preflop: blinds 2+4=6, plus raise 12 (seat2 adds 12?), seat2 raise 12 means they put 12 total (including big blind?). Usually raise to 12 means total bet 12. So pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (raise) = 18? Then call 8 adds 8 (since we already have 4). So pot becomes 26, matches given.\n\nNow flop: Jc As Jd. Opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop, now we have flop. We need to decide.\n\nWe have no pair, board is paired Jacks with Ace kicker. Opponent likely has strong hand: maybe AK, AQ, AJ, AA, JJ, or a set? Actually board has two Jacks, one Ace. So opponent could have Jx for trips, or AA for top pair top kicker, or AK for top pair Ace? Wait board: Jc As Jd. So top pair is Ace (if they have Ace). Actually they could have As? But As is on board, so they can't have Ace of spades. They could have Ace of hearts/diamonds/clubs. So they could have Ace high pair.\n\nWe have no pair, no draw. Likely we are behind. We have 0 equity.\n\nWe could consider folding, but we have already called preflop and we have 115 chips, but we might want to try a bluff? However board is paired, a scare card for opponent? Actually Jacks are scary for us but not for opponent. Our hand is weak; a bluff might be possible if opponent is weak and can fold, but we have no fold equity perhaps.\n\nWe need to check if we have any chance to improve on turn/river: we could get a straight? Board: J A J. To get straight we need KQ or QK? Actually need Ten-J-Q-K? We have Ten, so if turn is Q and river K we could make straight? Actually we need Ten-J-Q-K? That's 10-J-Q-K, need also? That's 4 cards; we need 5 cards, we have Ten, board J, we need Q and K and maybe something else. Not promising.\n\nWe could get flush if spades appear 3 more times: we have two spades in hand, need 3 spades on board. Unlikely.\n\nThus best is to check (since amount to call is 0). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since no bet, we can check. Checking is safe.\n\nBut maybe we could raise as a bluff? Minimum raise to 8 (total). That would be 8 into 26 pot, pot odds 26:8 = 3.25:1, we would need equity > 23.5% to be profitable. Our equity is near 0. So not good.\n\nThus we should check.\n\nProvide JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually need 9 to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Not possible. Ten with J: we have T, board J J A. The only possible straight is 9-10-J-Q-K, but we need 9 and Q and K. Not there. So no straight draw. We have a backdoor flush draw? Suited spades: board has clubs and diamonds, no spades, so we have 2 spades, could get flush on turn/river if two more spades appear.

Need to call 20 to win 66 => 30% equity needed. Our hand likely far less than 30% vs opponent's range.

So preflop: seat5 (us) posted SB 4? Wait line: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 4\" meaning we posted SB? But we are BB seat5. Might be mislabel. Actually seat5 is our seat, they posted small blind 4. Then seat1 posted big blind 8. So we are actually SB. Position: BB (Seat5) but they posted SB? Confusing. But we have already posted 4, now facing 8 from seat1 (big blind). So amount to call is 4 (to match 8). So we can call 4 (total 8) or raise min to 16 (total). Hand 3s Td is a weak hand, off-suit, not a good candidate for raising. Should we call? In SB with 13.9 BB, calling 4 to see flop with 3T is marginal. But could be a steal attempt by BB? Actually BB is the aggressor, they posted 8. In SB, we could call to see flop, but we are out of position post-flop (SB vs BB). Hand is not strong; we might fold. Typically 3T offsuit is a fold in SB vs a raise from BB. So fold.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Actually seat1 posted sb 4? Wait actions: Seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind), seat1 post_bb 8 (big blind). So seat1 is big blind, we are in BB? Actually position says BB seat5, but actions show seat5 posted sb. Contradiction: The hand description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but then actions: seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind). Probably mislabel but we treat as small blind? Actually seat5 is us, we posted small blind 4. Seat1 posted big blind 8. So we are SB, not BB. Our stack 99 includes the 4 we posted, so effective after posting SB is 95 remaining.\n\nWe face amount to call 4 (to match big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to total 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand Jd Qh is decent suited? Not suited (Jd Qh). Offsuit QJ is decent for a short stack? In early position (SB) vs BB only? Actually only two players left: us SB and BB (Kimi). So it's a heads-up preflop. With 12 BB, QJ offsuit is a decent hand, but we are short stack; we could consider a raise or call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi often raises preflop with amounts 6,12,24,18. In heads-up? The data not specific. But they have raised frequently. So they may be aggressive. As SB we can either raise to isolate or call to see flop cheap.\n\nOur stack: 99 chips, 12 BB. If we call 4, we will be 8 BB effective (since BB 8 + 4 call = 12 total pot). After call, pot will be 12+4 call? Actually pot currently 12 (SB 4 + BB 8). Call 4 adds to pot 4, making pot 16. Then flop effective stacks: we have 95 chips left (99-4). After call we have 91 left. Opponent will have 291 chips (assuming they haven't acted). Actually they posted 8, still have 317-8=309? Wait they have 325 chips total; posted 8, so 317 left.\n\nIf we raise to 16 (total), we add 12 more (since we already posted 4). That would be a raise of 12, making total bet 16. Opponent would need to call 8 more (since they already have 8 in pot). That would be a raise of 8. Minimum raise to 16 is correct.\n\nRaising to 16 would be 2x BB (since BB is 8). That's a standard raise. With 12 BB stack, raising to 16 is okay. If opponent re-raises (3-bet), they'd need to have enough chips.\n\nGiven we have QJ offsuit, we could raise to isolate, but we are short. If opponent is aggressive, they may 3-bet, we could be in trouble.\n\nCalling is also an option: see flop cheap, we have position post-flop (SB is first to act preflop, but after flop, SB is first to act? Actually in heads-up, SB is dealer, so after flop SB is first to act. So we would be out of position. So raising could give us initiative.\n\nGiven short stack, we might want to go all-in? Not allowed? Minimum raise to 16, we could raise all-in (99). But legal actions allow raise to any amount up to stack. We could go all-in to put pressure. However, with QJ offsuit, all-in may be too much risk.\n\nConsider tournament: 12 BB is short; we might want to accumulate chips. QJ offsuit is about 12% equity vs random hands. Might be okay to raise to 16 and try to win small pot. If opponent folds, we pick up 12 chips (increase stack). If they call, we are in a flop with 12 BB effective. Might be okay.\n\nThus I think raise to 16.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #45 flop. Position BB, we raised preflop to 16, opponent (Seat1) called 8 (so they put 8 more? Actually preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then BB raised to 16 (so added 8), Seat1 called 8 (so they put 8 more). So pot 32 (makes sense: SB 4, BB 8, BB raise to 16 total 16, seat1 call 8 extra? Actually pot: SB 4, BB 8 (big blind) then BB raises to 16 (so adds 8 more, total BB 16), seat1 calls 8 (so they put 8). So total contributions: SB 4, BB 16, seat1 8 = 28? plus maybe some miscalc, but pot shown 32. Might include the blind amounts? Anyway pot 32.\n\nWe have Jd Qh, board 3c 6s Ks. So we have overcards, gutshot straight draw? With J and Q, we have open-ended? Board: 3-6-K. Our hand: QJ gives us gutshot to a straight? 3-4-5-6-7? Actually we have 3,6,K. With J and Q, we could make straight if a 5 and 4? Let's see combos: Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 4 and 5). Our JQ not help. Also 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7-10). Not relevant. So no straight draw. We have two overcards to K (Q and J). Could make top pair if K pairs? Actually K is on board, we have no pair. So currently we have nothing, just two overcards.\n\nOpponent seat1: we have recall: they have been folding a lot preflop; in hand 30 they bet flop 4 and then folded. Hand 39 they raised preflop 12 and then folded (maybe after? Actually they raised then folded? Not sure). They seem somewhat passive, maybe can fold to aggression.\n\nNow it's our turn on flop after we raised preflop and opponent called. On flop, no bets yet. Amount to call 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total? Actually raise to total amount 8? Since pot 32, but min raise is 8). We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak. With only 87 chips stack, 10.9 BB, we are short-stacked but not ultra. Pot is 32, our stack 87. If we raise, we could commit chips. We could try to steal the pot with a continuation bet, representing strong hand. Opponent seems passive and may fold to c-bet. So raising (c-bet) could win pot 32 for maybe 8 chips (size). That's a good % of pot. If they call, we go to turn with weak hand; but we could then evaluate.\n\nGiven our stack, we can also consider shoving all-in? Minimum raise is 8, but we could go all-in if we want. But probably just raise to 8 (or maybe 12) as a c-bet.\n\nWe need to decide between check and raise. Check gives free cards and likely opponent will bet? They might check back. They are passive; they might check, then we could call? Not good.\n\nThus raise to 8 (or maybe 12) as continuation bet. Since min raise is 8, raising to 8 is small but okay. Pot odds: they need to call 8 to win 40 pot (32+8). That's 20% needed. Overcards have about 12% chance to pair top pair (Q or J) on turn? Actually turn unknown. Probability to improve? Not great. But we can win immediately.\n\nThus raise to 8.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

So gutshot open-ended? Actually only 10 works (and also maybe 9? 9-10-J-Q-K? No board has A, not part. So only 10). So we have one card outs for straight (10).

Anyway we raised to 16, opponent called 8. Flop: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So pot after flop: initial pot 8+8+16? Let's compute: Preflop: we posted 4 sb? Actually seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So we are SB? But position says BB. Might be confusion. Anyway pot after preflop: we raised 16 (so additional 12 beyond 4?), opponent called 8 (matching our raise). So contributions: we put 4+16=20? Actually raise 16 means total 16? Usually raise to 16 includes initial 4? Hard. But pot after preflop likely 4 (our sb) +8 (bb) +16 (our raise) +8 (opponent call) =36? Then flop bet 8 each, adds 16, pot 52? But given pot after flop is 48. So maybe numbers differ. Anyway pot is 48 now after flop betting.

Opponent bet 78 into pot 126+? Actually pot before turn action: after flop bet 8 and call 8, pot = preflop: 16+8 =24, plus flop 8+8 =16 => total 40? Wait compute: Preflop: we raised 16 (including SB 4? Actually we posted 4, then raise to 16 total? So we put 16? Usually raise to 16 means we put total 16, so net contribution 12 after posting 4. Opponent called 8 (big blind). So pot after preflop = 4+8+16 =28? Let's not worry. After flop bet 8 and call 8, pot adds 16 => pot maybe 44. Turn check then opponent bets 78. So pot now 44+78 =122? Actually they bet 78, so total pot after bet = 44+78 =122 (plus our check 0). So amount to call 78, pot odds: call 78 to win 122? Actually if we call, pot becomes 122+78=200? Wait we need correct: current pot before opponent bet = 44? Let's compute precisely: Preflop: SB 4 posted, BB 8 posted. Then we raise to 16 (so we add 12 more). Opponent calls 8 (so adds 8). So contributions: SB 4+12=16, BB 8. Pot = 24. Flop: we bet 8, opponent calls 8. So add 16 => pot = 40. Turn: we check, opponent bets 78. So pot now 40+78=118 (including his bet). Amount to call 78, total pot after call would be 118+78=196. So pot odds = 78/196 \u2248 0.398, need ~40% equity. Our hand has basically zero equity vs opponent's range. Need to consider opponent's range: He is Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 231, after bet 78 (which is about 62% of his stack). He is the SB? Actually seat1 posted BB 8, seat5 is BB? Wait seat5 is us BB, seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted BB 8, seat5 posted SB 4. So seat1 is big blind, we are small blind. Preflop we raised, he called. So on turn, he bets big (78) after board A K 6 3. That suggests he likely has strong hand: maybe AK, AQ, KQ, maybe a set? Board has K, A, 6,3. No pair on board besides maybe K? Actually board has K, A, 6,3. He could have AK, AA, KK, maybe a straight draw? Not likely. Could be a bluff? But bet is large, likely value.\n\nOur hand JQ is weak. Should fold. But maybe consider implied odds? No draws. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have pocket fours in BB with 71 chips (8.9 BB). Small blind posted 4, big blind posted 8. Player in seat2 (UTG? Actually seat2 is maybe under the gun) called 8 (just called). So pot is 20 (4+8+8). No raise yet. We're in BB with 4-4, a small pocket pair. With short stack 8.9 BB, we could consider a raise to try to steal or get value. But the opponent called from seat2 (maybe early position) with 251 chips, likely a decent stack. Pocket fours are not great for a steal from BB vs a caller who already called. But we could also check and see a flop cheap. However with 8.9 BB, we could consider a shove? Minimum raise is 16 (so raise to 16 total). That would be a raise of 8 more (since we already have 8 in). That would be a raise to 16 total, putting 8 more chips. That would be a small raise, not a shove. Could also raise more, but legal raise min is 16; we can raise higher up to our stack 71. With short stack, often push/fold. But we are already in BB with a medium small pair; raising to 16 may get called by a weak hand, but we risk being outdrawn.\n\nGiven stack 71, we could also go all-in (71) to try to double up. However opponent already called 8; they could have a wide range (maybe they have a hand like A2, etc). Pocket fours vs that range is about 50% equity? Actually vs random hand, pocket pair 4s vs random is about 55% preflop. So a shove could be profitable.\n\nBut we have a small blind posted 4, not in action. Actually seat1 folded, seat2 called, seat3 folded. So only seat2 is left. So it's us vs seat2. With 71 chips vs 251 chips, a shove is a classic short stack move. Minimum raise to 16 is not a shove; we can raise to 71 (all-in). That's likely best.\n\nThus action: raise to 71 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So output.\n\n",

Call would leave us with 67 chips, still 8.4 BB. Could we fold? Likely fold, as 7T offsuit is not good enough to call a raise from early position with short stack. Could we raise?

Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises to 20 (so raise to 20 total). Amount to call is 16 (since SB already posted 4, need 16 more to match 20). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise at least to 32 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: 8d6d is a suited connector, decent for short stack maybe can go all-in if raise is big enough. But we have 87 chips, 10.9 BB, raise to 20 is 2.5 BB (since big blind 8). Our stack is 87, we could call 16 (2 BB) and still have 71 chips left. Could also raise all-in (87) but minimum raise is 32, we could raise to 32 (4 BB) or go all-in.\n\nConsider opponent DeepSeek-V3.2's behavior: from recall, they have raised 10 (small) in hand 37, raised 40 in hand 39 (big), otherwise fold a lot. They also called a 4 (hand 44) and bet 8 on flop after calling. They also checked and folded flop in hand 47. So they are somewhat variable; they sometimes raise big, sometimes fold. Not much data.\n\nOur hand 8d6d is marginal. In short stack, we could consider a shove (all-in) to try to steal blinds? But there is a raise already from opponent, so it's a 3-way? Actually only SB and the raiser (DeepSeek) plus BB (who posted 8 but hasn't acted yet? Wait order: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then DeepSeek (seat 3) raises to 20. In SB, we act first (since SB is after BB? Actually order preflop: after blinds, action starts with UTG (seat left of BB). But here only players are SB (seat5), BB (seat1), and seat3 (DeepSeek). The order: UTG would be seat2 (folded), then seat3 (DeepSeek) acts, raising. Then action continues clockwise to seat4 (folded), seat5 (SB) acts, then seat1 (BB) acts. So SB is next to act after raise. So we can call or raise.\n\nGiven we have a short stack, but not ultra short. 8d6d is not a premium hand. Typically we would fold to a raise unless we have a good chance to double up. Could consider a 3-bet (raise) to isolate and go all-in? Raising to 32 would be a 4 BB raise, still less than our stack. Could also go all-in (87) to apply pressure. But opponent's raise to 20 is only 2.5 BB; they might be trying to steal or just opening with a wide range. Our 8d6d can flop well, but we risk being dominated.\n\nStack depth: effective stack is 87 (our stack) vs opponent's 252. So if we go all-in and they call, we could double up to ~339. That's a good move if we have decent equity vs their range. What is their range? With 2.5 BB raise, could be wide: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, maybe even some weaker. 8d6d is decent against that.\n\nBut also we have a blind already posted; we are short stack, maybe we should shove to try to get chips.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 87 chips, others have 341, 279, 252. We are short stack, need to survive. So a shove could be appropriate if hand has decent equity vs opponent's raising range. 8d6d suited has about 30% equity vs random (maybe 30-35%). Against a raising range of maybe 20% of hands, equity maybe ~30%. That could be enough to shove.\n\nBut we also have the BB behind who hasn't acted yet. If we call 16, BB could raise or call. If we raise all-in, BB could fold or call. Not sure.\n\nGiven we have a short stack and marginal hand, I think best is to go all-in (raise to 87) to maximize chance of doubling up. However need to ensure legal raise: minimum raise to 32, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So raise_to 87.\n\nThus decision: raise (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, need to accumulate, hand has decent suited connector equity, opponent's raise is small, we can apply pressure.\n\nLet's produce"

The order: UTG would be seat2 (folded), then seat3 (DeepSeek) acts, raising. Then action continues clockwise to seat4 (folded), seat5 (SB) acts, then seat1 (BB) acts. So SB is next to act after raise. So we can call or raise.\n\nGiven we have a short stack, but not ultra short. 8d6d is not a premium hand. Typically we would fold to a raise unless we have a good chance to double up. Could consider a 3-bet (raise) to isolate and go all-in? Raising to 32 would be a 4 BB raise, still less than our stack. Could also go all-in (87) to apply pressure. But opponent's raise to 20 is only 2.5 BB; they might be trying to steal or just opening with a wide range. Our 8d6d can flop well, but we risk being dominated.\n\nStack depth: effective stack is 87 (our stack) vs opponent's 252. So if we go all-in and they call, we could double up to ~339. That's a good move if we have decent equity vs their range. What is their range? With 2.5 BB raise, could be wide: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, maybe even some weaker. 8d6d is decent against that.\n\nBut also we have a blind already posted; we are short stack, maybe we should shove to try to get chips.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 87 chips, others have 341, 279, 252. We are short stack, need to survive. So a shove could be appropriate if hand has decent equity vs opponent's raising range. 8d6d suited has about 30% equity vs random (maybe 30-35%). Against a raising range of maybe 20% of hands, equity maybe ~30%. That could be enough to shove.\n\nBut we also have the BB behind who hasn't acted yet. If we call 16, BB could raise or call. If we raise all-in, BB could fold or call. Not sure.\n\nGiven we have a short stack and marginal hand, I think best is to go all-in (raise to 87) to maximize chance of doubling up. However need to ensure legal raise: minimum raise to 32, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So raise_to 87.\n\nThus decision: raise (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, need to accumulate, hand has decent suited connector equity, opponent's raise is small, we can apply pressure.\n\nLet's produce",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #54 preflop, BTN 8c7d, stack 119 (14.9 BB). Blinds 4/8, SB seat1 posted 4, BB seat2 posted 8. So pot 12. Action: we are facing BB 8 (already posted) and SB 4. Actually we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, action is on us to act first preflop (since it's BTN). The amount to call is 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength: 8c7d suited? No, 8c and 7d are unsuited (clubs and diamonds). So offsuit connectors, low. Not a premium hand. In early tournament with 14.9 BB, short stackish but not ultra short. 8c7d off-suit is a marginal hand. As BTN, we have position but not a strong hand. Options: call (8) to see flop for cheap speculation. Raise? Could be a steal attempt, but the blinds are small relative to stack (SB 4, BB 8). Our raise to 16 would be 2 BB raise (since big blind is 8). That's a standard raise size (2 BB). With 8c7d offsuit, raising is not typical; could be a bluff if we think opponents are tight. But we have some stack; calling is cheap and we can see flop.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: seat1 (SB) and seat2 (BB). Look at recall: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raises amounts: often small raises (6, 12). But they are SB, maybe they raise from SB sometimes. But we have no info on their fold to raises. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raises amounts: 6, 12, 24, etc. So both may be aggressive.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, best to fold or call? Call is cheap (8) and we can see flop. If we call, we will be out of position postflop (but we are BTN, after flop we will be first to act preflop? Actually after flop, BTN is last to act preflop, but after flop, action starts with SB then BB then BTN. So we will be last (position) after flop as well, which is good. So calling is okay.\n\nPot odds: pot 12, call 8 => pot will be 20 after call. So we invest 8 to potentially win 20 (pot odds 2.5:1). Hand equity of 8c7d vs unknown range? Likely low, maybe ~10-12% vs random. Not enough.\n\nThus fold might be best to preserve chips. But we have 14.9 BB, we can afford to fold a marginal hand. However, we could also call and try to hit a straight or two pair. But with such low stack, we need to accumulate chips.\n\nGiven typical tournament strategy: with 15 BB, you want to be selective but also look for steal opportunities. 8c7d off-suit is not a steal candidate; you would usually raise with stronger hands (broadway, suited connectors). So folding is reasonable.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Shoving all\u2011in would be too risky with a marginal hand, and folding forfeits any chance to improve. Therefore we call the 52\u2011chip raise.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have pocket 6s, small stack 111 chips, blinds 8. After SB 4, BB 8, UTG? Actually seat2 raise 24 (3bb). Seat3 (DeepSeek) re-raises to 60 (7.5bb). So we face a 3-bet to 60, we are in BB, stack 111, pot currently 92 (blinds+SB+BB+raise+re-raise? Let's compute: SB 4, BB 8, seat2 raise to 24 (so put 24, call 24? Actually seat2 raised from 8? Wait seat2 is UTG maybe? He raised to 24, that means he put 24 total, adding 24-8? But BB already posted 8, so seat2's raise is 24 total, meaning 24-8 =16 extra. Then seat3 re-raises to 60, meaning adds 60-24=36. So pot = SB 4 + BB 8 + seat2 24 + seat3 60 = 96? But they say pot 92 chips. Might be rounding. Anyway, amount to call is 52 (to match 60). Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise to 96 total). Our stack 111, so we could call 52 leaving 59 chips, or raise all-in 111. Pocket 6s is a small pair, not great against likely stronger ranges. 3-bet from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat3) maybe aggressive. Our stack short, we could consider calling to set mine, but 6s set odds? Against 3-bet, calling with small pair is okay if implied odds good. However tournament, short stack 13.9 BB, we could either call and hope to hit set (12% chance). If we call, we will be out of position post-flop against a 3-bettor, likely will have to fold unless set. If we go all-in, we are raising to 111 (total). That would be a raise to 111, which is above min raise. That would be a shove. Is that profitable? Our hand is small pair, not strong enough to shove vs 3-bet. Better to call and try set. But we have only 59 chips left after call, still short. If we call and miss set, we likely fold. So expected value: 12% chance win pot (maybe 96+?), but we also risk 52 chips. EV = 0.12* (pot after call? pot would be 60+52 call? Actually we call 52, pot becomes 92+52 =144? Wait initial pot 92 includes seat3's 60. So after we call 52, pot = 92+52 =144. If we hit set, we likely win the pot plus maybe opponent's remaining stack? Opponent seat3 has 184 chips total, after 60 in pot, they have 124 left. Our call leaves us 59 left. If we hit set, we could be all-in for 59 vs their 124? Actually we are not all-in, just called. But they could bet later. So maybe not great.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe better to shove all-in to try to steal blinds? But we have a pair, not a steal. However raising all-in may force fold from seat2 and seat3 if they think we have premium. But seat3 just 3-bet, likely strong. So likely they'd call. Not good.\n\nThus best is call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have 6, board 7-9, missing 8 for gutshot straight (needs 8). Also need 5 for 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 6, board 7,9, need 8 and 5? Not relevant. So we have a low pair, likely losing to overpairs, J, etc. Opponent seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 59 into pot 203 (so about 0.29 pot). Their betting pattern: historically small flop bets (4,8,15) relative to pot. This seems a continuation bet, maybe with a wide range. Our hand is weak. We have 59 to call, min raise 118 but we cannot raise (legal only fold/call). So we can call or fold. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 203 + opponent bet 59 = 262 total after call. Call 59 to win 262 => odds 4.44:1. Need win >22.5% to be profitable. Our hand likely far less. So fold.\n\nBut consider tournament situation: stack 59 chips (7.4 BB). We're short-stacked, but we have 59 chips left (including 8 BB). Actually we have 59 chips total, we already posted 8 BB, we called 52 preflop, leaving 59? Wait stack after preflop call: Starting stack 59, posted 8 BB, called 52 (makes total 60? Actually call 52 includes 8? In preflop, we posted 8 BB then called 52 additional? Usually call amount includes BB? The action says call 52 meaning you put 52 total (including BB?) Not sure. But they say stack 59 chips now, so after posting BB and calling preflop, we have 59 left. So we are very short, 7.4 BB. On flop, opponent bets 59 (our entire stack). So calling would be all-in. Actually amount to call 59 equals our stack. So calling would be all-in, we risk elimination. Our hand is very weak; likely fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Actually we already posted BB 8, SB 4, then seat2 called 8, so we need to call 0? But they say amount to call: 4. Probably because we posted BB 8, SB 4, seat2 called 8, we need to call 0? Wait: In BB, after SB and BB posted, the action starts with UTG (seat2). Seat2 called 8 (so just called big blind). Then it's our turn in BB, we have already posted 8, so amount to call is 0. But they say amount to call: 4. Maybe they treat the small blind as amount to call? Actually if SB is 4, BB is 8, UTG calls 8, then BB can check (no further bet). So amount to call should be 0. But the system says amount to call: 4. Might be a mistake: perhaps seat2 raised to 8? No, they said call 8. So maybe they treat BB as still needing to call the small blind? That's weird.\n\nGiven legal actions: fold, call, raise. So call would be 4 (maybe to match the SB?). Let's assume we need to call 4 to match the small blind? Actually we are already posted 8, but maybe the pot is 20 (SB+BB+call) = 4+8+8 =20, correct. So amount to call 4 maybe is the difference between our BB 8 and the call 8? No difference. Could be that they treat the small blind as the amount to call because we are out of position? Not sure.\n\nAnyway we have a weak hand 2c7c, not suited for flush? both clubs, but low. Should we fold? In BB with 6.9 BB, with such a weak hand, folding is fine. But we could also call the 4 to see flop cheap. But with 2c7c, not great. In tournament early stage? Stack 55 chips vs blinds 8, so 6.9 BB, short stack. Might want to try to double up. But 2c7c is very weak, not a good candidate to steal. Could consider raising? Minimum raise to 16, which is 8 more than call? Actually raise to 16 total (so raise 8 more). That's 2 BB raise. Could be a steal attempt but hand is terrible. So likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: seat2 maybe just called big blind, maybe not aggressive. But we have no reason to play weak hand.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So they may be opening wide? 24 is 3x BB (since BB is 8). That's a standard open size (3BB). In a 5.9 BB stack, we are short-stacked. Q7 offsuit is a weak hand. In BB, we could consider a shove if we think we are short enough. But we have 47 chips, which is about 5.9 BB. Minimum raise to 40, which would be a raise of 32 total (8 already posted). Actually we have posted 8 BB, call amount 16 to match 24 raise, making total 24. Minimum raise to 40 means raise total to 40, i.e., add 32 more (total 40). That would be a raise of 32, which is 4 BB more (since 8 BB is 8). Our stack 47, we could raise to 40, leaving 7 chips behind (i.e., we could go all-in for 47). But raising to 40 is allowed. Should we call 16? That would leave us 31 chips after call. But we would be out of position post-flop, with a weak hand. Likely best to fold. However with short stack maybe we could shove all-in (raise to 47) to try to steal blinds? But opponent just raised, not a blind steal. We are in BB, they raised from UTG? Actually seat 2 is early position (maybe UTG). Raising 24 suggests they have a decent hand. Q7 offsuit doesn't play well.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop in BB with 4h Ac, stack 39, blinds 8/16, pot 24. Effective stack is 39, after posting big blind 16, we have 23 left to act (plus 16 already in pot). We face a call amount of 8 (to match SB? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, so amount to call is 8 to call the SB's raise? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, so BB is already 16 in, SB is 8, so amount to call is 8 to match SB. So we can call 8 to see flop, or raise min to 32 (total). Our hand A4 offsuit, weak Ace. With short stack (2.4 BB) we might consider going all-in? Actually min raise is 32, which would be total 32 chips, meaning we need to put additional 16 (since we already have 16). That would be 32 total, leaving us 7 chips left (since stack 39). That's a decent raise for a short stack, but A4 is weak. Could also just call 8 and hope to see flop, but with such short stack you might want to be aggressive or fold. In BB, with only 2.4 BB left, you are short-stacked. A4 offsuit is not great for a shove. Usually you would shove with any Ace when short-stacked? At 2.4 BB, you could shove all-in (which is 39 total). But min raise to 32 is less than all-in. You could raise to 32 (i.e., put 16 more) leaving 7 left, then likely be forced all-in later. Might be better to shove all-in to maximize fold equity. But you only have 39 chips; if you raise to 32, you still have 7 left, you could be called and then you still have 7 to act later (post-flop). Might be okay.\n\nWhat about opponent tendencies? There's only Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) left to act after us? Actually order: SB (Seat5) posted sb? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking? Actually seat5 is us. The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8? That seems weird: seat5 is BB but posted sb 8? Might be mislabel. Actually seat5 posted sb 8 (so we are SB?), seat1 posted bb 16 (so seat1 is BB). So we are in SB, not BB. The description says Position: BB (Seat5) but actions show seat5 post_sb 8. Possibly they swapped? Anyway we are small blind with 8 posted, big blind is seat1 with 16. So amount to call is 8 (to match big blind). So we are SB with A4 offsuit, stack 39, 2.4 BB. We can call 8, raise to 32 (minimum), or fold.\n\nGiven short stack, typical strategy: If you have Ace, you can shove all-in (or raise) to try to steal blinds. A4 is weak but still Ace high, but against unknown opponent could be okay. However, we have a 2.4 BB stack, raising to 32 leaves 7 chips, which is still short. Might as well go all-in (raise to 39) to maximize pressure. But min raise is 32, but we can raise to any amount up to all-in, as long as it's a legal raise. So we can raise to 39 (all-in). That would be a raise of 31 more (since we already posted 8). That is a raise to total 39. Is that allowed? Yes, raise_to is total amount you put in. So raise_to 39.\n\nWe need to consider opponent: Seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, likely a typical player. With 2.4 BB, you want to either fold or push. A4 is not premium but could be used to push.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving chips is important but also stealing blinds is good. With only 39 chips, you need to build. So I think go all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 39, reasoning.\n\n",

We are to act facing BB 16 (already posted). Amount to call 16 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have a short stack (3.9 BB). Jd8d suited is a marginal hand, but can be used for a steal or shove. With 3.9 BB, typical strategy is to either shove all-in or fold, rarely raise small. Since min raise is 32, that would be a raise to 32 total, which is 2 BB more than call (call 16, raise to 32). That would be 2 BB raise (i.e., 2x BB). That's a 2BB raise, which is a small raise but still above min. However with such a short stack, better to either shove all-in (63 chips) or call and hope to see flop cheap? But calling 16 leaves us with 47 left, still short.\n\nGiven position BTN, we could attempt to steal the blinds by raising all-in. Opponents: Seat1 (SB) Kimi-K2 with 305 chips, Seat2 (BB) also Kimi-K2 with 259 chips? Actually both seats have same name, maybe same player? Two opponents: one SB, one BB. Their tendencies: recall shows they sometimes raise preflop (24 chips raise), sometimes call small (4), sometimes check. They seem to be somewhat tight? Hard to tell. In previous hands they raised to 24 (i.e., 1.5 BB) preflop. That's a moderate raise. They also sometimes call small amounts.\n\nGiven our stack, if we call 16, we will be out of position post-flop with J8 suited. Not great. Better to go all-in to maximize fold equity, especially against SB who might fold. BB might call with a wide range? BB's stack is 259, they could call with many hands.\n\nThus I think best is to raise all-in (i.e., raise to 63). Since raise_to should be total amount we put in. Our stack is 63 chips. So raise_to 63.\n\nWe need to ensure legal: raise is allowed. Minimum raise to 32, we can raise to 63 (all-in). So action: raise, raise_to: 63.\n\nReasoning: short stack, suited connectors marginal, better to go all-in to steal blinds, etc.\n\nThus produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on flop. Situation: BB (seat5) with Qs Ks, board Jh Jd 4c. Preflop we were in BB, posted 1, then raise 12 after opponent raise to 4? Actually actions: Seat4 raise 4 (UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2). Then Seat5 raise 12 (re-raise). Seat1 folds. Seat4 raise 20 (3-bet). Seat5 call 8 (call to 20). So pot 42 includes blinds etc. Now flop: Jh Jd 4c. So we have QsKs, no pair, no draw. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised preflop, likely a strong range (maybe broadway, pairs). On flop, opponent likely continuation bet? But amount to call is 0, meaning opponent checked? Wait actions: amount to call 0, so we have option to check or raise. So opponent (MiniMax) must have checked. So board: double Jacks, 4c. Our hand QK, overcards. No flush draw (two clubs on board? Actually 4c is club, we have Qs Ks, both spades and hearts? Qs, Ks, both spades? Actually Qs is spade, Ks spade. So no club. So no flush draw. Straight draw? J-4, we have K Q, could make straight if 10 and 9? Actually need 10 and 9 for straight with J J 4? Not possible. So just overcards.\n\nWe need to decide check or raise. Consider opponent's range: preflop they raised to 4 (open), then 3-bet to 20 after our re-raise. They are likely strong: maybe AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe suited connectors. On flop double Jacks, they likely have Jacks, maybe overpair (AA, KK, QQ), or AK/AQ etc. They checked, maybe they missed, or they have a hand like AK that wants to see turn. We have QK, which is overcards, but no pair. If we bet, we could represent a jack? But we have no jack. Could we bluff? Could be effective if opponent folds weaker hands like AQ? Actually AQ would have Q, but they'd have top pair with queen kicker? Wait board J J 4, AQ has queen, not a pair. So they'd have overcards. So they'd likely fold to a bet if they have weak overcards. But also they might have Jacks, they'd call. So risk.\n\nWe have a fairly deep stack (89 BB). Pot 42. A raise could be maybe 2-3x pot? That would be about 84-126 chips. That might pressure. But if they have Jacks they'd call. If they have overpair they'd maybe call as well. So we risk losing many chips. Maybe better to check and see turn.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB but flop is after opponent checked, we are first to act? Actually we are BB, opponent is seat4 (UTG?) They are left of us? The action order is from left of button? In flop, the first active player to the left of the button acts first. The button is seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB? Wait seat1 is SB? Actually preflop: Seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat4 is UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, they opened raise preflop. So flop action order: seat4 (UTG) is first, then seat5 (SB). Since seat4 checked, seat5 acts next. So we are out of position (first to act after opponent). So raising is a bluff, but we are out of position, which is less effective.\n\nThus best to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\nReasoning: we have no pair, only overcards, opponent likely strong, check to preserve.\n\n",

Pot after flop: preflop pot 2 (bb) + raise 4+12+20+8? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 4 (seat4), raise to 12 (seat5), raise to 20 (seat4), call 8 (seat5). So after preflop, pot: SB 1+BB 2+4+12+20+8 = 47? Actually need to sum contributions: seat4 put 4 then 20 (total 24). seat5 put 1 (sb) +12 +8 =21. seat1 put 2 (bb). So pot = 2+1+24+21 =48? Wait double-check: SB is seat5 posted 1, BB seat1 posted 2. Then seat4 raise to 4 (so adds 2 more beyond 2? Actually big blind is 2, seat4 raise to 4 means he puts 4 total, so net contribution 4). Then seat5 raise to 12 (adds 11 more beyond 1). Then seat1 folds. Then seat4 raise to 20 (adds 16 more). Then seat5 call 8 (adds 8 more). So total contributions: seat4: 4+16 =20? Wait raise to 20 means total 20, not add 16? He already had 4 in, so adds 16. So seat4 total =20. seat5 total = 1+11+8 =20. seat1 =2. So pot =20+20+2 =42. But the given pot before flop is 78 after flop betting? Actually after flop, pot is 78 chips. Flop: seat5 check (no bet), seat4 bet 18, seat5 call 18. So pot adds 36 to previous 42 =78. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2s. Pot 78, we have Qs Ks. Opponent's range likely includes strong Jacks (set), two pair, maybe overpairs like AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe draws? He bet 18 on flop, we called, so he might have a made hand or a draw. Turn card is 2s, which likely doesn't help many draws except maybe a gutshot? Not relevant.\n\nOur hand is likely losing. We could check or fold. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we check and hope river? Likely we should just check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising is not good.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn scenario. Our hand: Qs Ks. Board: Jh Jd 4c 2s. So we have QK with no pair, we have a gutshot? Actually board has J J 4 2. We have overcards, but also possible straight draws? Board: J J 4 2. Our hand Q K. Potential: we have a backdoor straight draw? Not really. We have two overcards, could make top pair if a Jack hits, but we already have two Jacks on board, so any Jack would give opponent a set if they have J. But we have no pair. Our hand currently is just high cards, no pair, no draw. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 18 on turn after we checked. Pot currently 96+18+18 (flop bet and call) = 132? Let's compute: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, then raise to 4 (MiniMax) then raise to 12 (us) then raise to 20 (MiniMax) then call 8 (us) = contributions: seat4: 4 + 20 = 24? Actually seat4 raise 4 (initial) then later raise to 20 (i.e., added 16 more) total 20? Wait: preflop: seat4 raise 4 (so puts 4). seat5 raise 12 (so puts 12). seat1 fold. seat4 raise 20 (so total 20). seat5 call 8 (so puts additional 8 to match 20). So contributions: seat4: 20, seat5: 12+8=20. plus blinds: seat5 posted small blind 1, seat1 posted big blind 2. So total pot after preflop: 20+20+1+2 = 43? But also seat5 posted SB 1 earlier, but then raised 12 (including the 1? Usually raise to 12 means total 12, so additional 11). But we can approximate pot after preflop maybe 43. Flop: seat5 check (0), seat4 bet 18, seat5 call 18. So pot adds 36, total pot 79. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 18. So pot before turn bet: 79. After bet 18, pot becomes 97. The amount to call is 18, making total pot after call 115. So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely opponent has something like a set (J), two pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a made hand. We have no showdown value. Should we fold? Probably yes. But we need to consider stack depth: we have 160 chips, opponent 141. Bet 18 is about 11% of our stack. Could we bluff? Probably not with QK, not strong enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall turn actions of MiniMax-M2. The tool returned none (no data). So we have no info. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 called the BB from CO? Actually seat 4 is CO (since BTN seat5, seat4 is CO). They just called. They may be playing a wide range from CO. K3 is okay to raise? Might be okay to raise for value and isolation. But we have relatively deep stack (80 BB) and can open raise to 4 (2x BB). Typically open raise 2.5-3 BB. So raising to 4 is fine. However we need to consider that they already called. We are in position, can either raise or call. Raising could isolate and get folds from later players (none left). Only SB and BB are already in pot. SB already posted 1, BB 2, and CO called 2. So raising may get them to call more. SB might fold or call. BB might call or raise. K3 is not a strong hand for a 3-bet; but a raise from BTN is standard open, not a 3-bet. So it's okay to raise to 4. The pot after raise would be 5 + 4 (our raise) = 9? Actually current pot 5 (SB1+BB2+CO2). If we raise to 4 total, we add 2 more chips (since we need to call 2 then raise 2 more). So new pot 7? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, CO 2, we put 4 total (so we add 4). So total pot = 1+2+2+4 =9. Yes.\n\nCalling just adds 2, making pot 7. K3 has some equity but not great vs unknown range. Raising may fold SB and BB if they are tight. Could also get a call from them, building pot. Considering tournament early stage? Stack 80 BB, still deep. Might want to preserve chips, but also accumulate. K3 is not a hand to risk too much; but raising to 4 is low risk.\n\nCheck is not allowed because amount to call is 2. So options fold, call, raise.\n\nGiven typical strategy, I would raise to 4 to try to steal blinds and isolate CO. So decision: raise to 4.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: we are BTN with 3d Kh. Board: 9d Qh 5d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with King high, plus backdoor straight possibilities? Not really. Also we have gutshot? 3d Kh gives us king high, no pair. We have a flush draw (4 outs to make flush? Actually we have two diamonds (3d) and board has two diamonds (9d,5d) so we have 4 diamonds total, need one more diamond to make flush. There are 13 diamonds total, 4 known, so 9 outs. Also we have an overcard King to board (Q,9,5). Potential for top pair if a K hits? Not on board. So currently we have 0 pair, but we have a backdoor straight? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 is on the button? Actually they are seat 4, which is CO? Seats: 1 SB, 2 BB, 3 (?), 4 is MiniMax-M2, 5 is us. So seat 4 is likely cutoff (CO). Preflop: they called 2 after we raised to 4, so they have a hand that can call a 2BB raise. They could have a wide range: suited connectors, broadways, etc.\n\nFlop: they bet 2 into pot 13. That's a small bet (about 1/3 pot). Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) with a wide range, possibly also a draw, or a weak hand. They might be trying to see cheap. Our hand: flush draw with overcards. Pot odds: call 2 to win 13+2 = 15 pot? Actually pot currently 13, they bet 2, so total pot after call = 13+2+2 = 17? Wait: pot before flop bet = 13. They bet 2, so if we call, we add 2, making pot 15? Let's calculate: preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus our raise 4 and their call 2? Actually preflop: SB 1, BB 2, we raise to 4 (so we put 4, they already posted 2, need 2 more), they call 2, they put total 4? Wait: preflop actions: Seat1 post_sb 1, Seat2 post_bb 2, Seat3 fold, Seat4 call 2 (so they call the raise, they put 2 more to match our 4? Actually raise to 4 means total 4, they had posted 2, need 2 more, they call 2). Seat5 raise 4 (we raise to 4, we put 4). Seat1 fold, Seat2 fold, Seat4 call 2 (they call our raise). So preflop contributions: SB 1, BB 2, us 4, them 4 (2 call + 2 call). Total pot = 1+2+4+4 = 11? But given pot is 13. Maybe includes antes? Not relevant. Anyway pot is 13, they bet 2, so pot after bet = 15, call 2 makes pot 17. So calling 2 gives us 2 to win 15 (pot before call). So pot odds = 2/15 \u2248 13.3%, we need about 13% equity. Our flush draw has about 9 outs, plus maybe some combos for pair? Actually we also have overcard King, could pair on turn or river. So total outs maybe ~12? Approx equity ~ (outs*2)/100 = 18% on turn, plus additional on river ~? So we have >13% equity, so call is profitable.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., total 4). That would be a raise of 2 extra beyond call? Actually they bet 2, raise to 4 means add 2 more. That would be a small raise, maybe to protect or to build pot. But raising could be risky if they have strong hand and re-raise. Our hand is not strong enough to raise for value. Could raise as semi-bluff to fold out better hands? Their bet is small; raising may just get called and we risk more chips.\n\nGiven we have a decent draw and pot odds are good, best is call.\n\nCheck stack: 156 chips, 78 BB, we can afford call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BTN with 3d Kh (King high, 3 of diamonds). Board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. So after turn, board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. Turn card is? Not specified; board shows 4 cards: 9d Qh 5d 8c. The turn is 8c (since flop had 9d Qh 5d, turn 8c). So board now: 9d Qh 5d 8c. We have King of hearts and 3 of diamonds. Our hand: currently a gutshot? We have a straight draw? Let's see possible straight: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have Q on board, need J and K? We have K, missing J and 10. Not a straight yet. Also we have a flush draw? Board has two diamonds (9d,5d) and we have 3d, so three diamonds total. Need two more diamonds for flush, not there yet. So currently we have high card K, maybe pair? No. So we have nothing, just K high.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) is in seat 4, has been playing. Preflop they called 2 (small blind?), they are in BB? Actually seat 2 is BB, seat 4 called 2 preflop (so they were in SB? Wait seat 1 posted sb 1, seat 2 posted bb 2. Seat 4 call 2: that suggests they were in UTG? Actually they called big blind? But they are not in blind, they just called 2. So they have a random hand.\n\nFlop: board 9d Qh 5d. Opponent bet 2 (small). We called 2. So they are continuing aggression.\n\nTurn: opponent bet 2 again (small). We need to decide.\n\nOur stack 154, pot 17, opponent bet 2, so pot after call would be 19. We have K high, no draw. Likely fold.\n\nBut consider tournament situation: 77 BB, opponent 229 chips, we have 154. We could consider a bluff raise? Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4). That's a raise of 2 more chips. Could attempt a steal? But we are out of position? Actually we are BTN, we are in position (acting after them). They bet 2, we could raise to 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). That would be a small raise. But with K high, maybe we can bluff as they may have missed the turn. However they bet again, suggests they have something or are bluffing. Could be a draw or made hand. Our K high is weak.\n\nGiven pot odds: To call 2 to win 17 (plus opponent's 2?), pot is 17, they bet 2 making pot 19, call 2 wins 19. So pot odds 2/19 ~10.5%, good. But we have no equity; we would only call if we think we have some chance to improve on river (maybe a straight draw?). After turn, board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. We have Kh 3d. Potential outs: Straight draw? Let's check: we could have a straight with 7-6? Actually board: 5-8-9-Q. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 6 and 7). Not possible. 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7,10,J). Not. 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10,J). We have K, not. 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 10,J). So we have K, but need 10 and J. Not many outs. Flush draw: we have 3d, board has 9d,5d. Need two more diamonds on river, impossible (only one card left). So no outs. So we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n",

Call would just call 2 (i.e., limp) which is rarely good UTG with AJ suited. Raise is standard. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 short stack (47 chips) may be willing to shove or call all-in. Their raise patterns: they raised to 4 (min) in hand 4 and 9, also raised larger amounts 20,28. So they are aggressive. As we raise, they may either call or shove all-in. But we have decent stack. Raising to 4 (i.e., 2 raise) is small; maybe we should raise to 6 (standard 3x BB) or 8? Minimum raise to 4 is only 2 more chips. But typical raise size is 3-4 BB, i.e., 6-8 chips. Since we have deep stack, we can raise to maybe 8. Legal actions allow raise to any amount up to stack. We should raise to 8 (total). Reason: open-raise with AJ suited from UTG is strong, want to build pot and isolate, also protect against being raised all-in later. Also short stack may shove, but we can call.\n\nThus decision: raise to 8.\n\nCheck if any other opponent might fold. Good.\n\nProvide JSON.",

We have a backdoor flush draw (two diamonds, need two more). Opponent seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG? seat3). We called with 7d8d (suited connector). Now flop 7c 9h 5s. Opponent's action? Not shown. We have amount to call 0, so opponent checked? Actually after flop, actions list not included. Since amount to call 0, it's our turn, we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot bet (raise is the only bet). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount. Minimum raise to 4 means total bet of 4 chips (since pot 13). So we can raise to 4 (i.e., bet 4). Need to consider opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG likely strong: maybe 66+, AQs+, etc. Could include 7x combos? 7-8 suited could be in range but less likely. On flop with 7c, they likely have top pair (9s) or overpairs (TT+, maybe 99? Actually board 7c 9h 5s, overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA would be ahead of our pair. They could also have 9x, 79, 78, 67, 56 draws. Our pair 7s is second pair. Might be behind many. But we have backdoor flush and gutshot. Pot is 13, we have 148 stack. Should we check to see opponent's action? If we bet, we might get called by better hands, losing value. Checking may give us free card, but also allow opponent to bet and we may be forced to call with marginal hand. Considering we are out of position (BB vs UTG), maybe check. But we have a decent hand (pair of 7s) but board is relatively dry. Could we check-raise? Not allowed because opponent hasn't bet. So we can either bet small to protect against draws? There are potential straight draws like 6-8, 6-7, 8-6, but not many. Might be okay to bet 4 (about 1/3 pot) to get value from worse hands (like 6-6, 5-6, 8-5, etc.) and protect. Opponent's range includes maybe 66, 55 (but 55 is set? Actually board has 5s, so 55 would be set, they'd bet). 66 would be overpair, they'd likely bet. So betting may get called by better, losing. Checking might induce opponent to bet with worse (like a draw) and we can call. But we risk giving free card.\n\nGiven tournament, we have a medium stack, but not short.

Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG? seat3). He now bets 15 into pot 28 (pot after flop: 28? Actually preflop pot: blinds 1+2+6+2? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6 (so total 6+1+2? Actually raise to 6 means put 6 total, so extra 4 from UTG plus 1 from SB and 2 from BB? But anyway pot 28 given). He bets 15. We have 148 stack, effective stack ~ 148-? we have 148 total, we put 2 BB preflop, call 4, now 15 to call. So decision: call, raise, or fold.\n\nHand strength: Pair of sevens, top pair? Board: 7c 9h 5s. Opponent may have 9x, 7x, 5x, maybe straight draws like 6-8, 8-10, etc. Our 7d8d gives us pair and open-ended? Actually we have 7 and 8, board 7,9,5. So we have pair of sevens, plus we have 8 gives us gutshot to 6-10? Wait need 6 for straight: 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight, we have 7 and 8, board 5,9, need 6 to complete. So gutshot. Also we have backdoor flush draw (diamonds) but board has no diamond. So limited.\n\nOpponent bet 15, about half pot (pot 28). So pot odds: need 15 to win pot of 43 (28+15). So odds ~ 35% needed. Our equity vs random? Probably less. But we need to consider opponent's range: Preflop raise from UTG likely strong: maybe 77+, AJs+, KQs, etc. Could also be suited connectors. On flop 7c9h5s, he bets. He could have 9x, 7x, 5x, overpairs, AK, etc. Our hand is likely second best unless he missed. We have pair of sevens, but board also has 7, so we have top pair? Could be if opponent doesn't have a 7. But opponent could have 9, overpair, etc. So calling is risky.\n\nWe have stack 148, can we raise? Minimum raise to 30 (so raise to 30). That would be a raise of 15 more. Could be a semi-bluff? With gutshot and backdoor flush, but not great. Might fold.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have 74 BB, decent stack, but not huge. Likely best to fold to preserve stack.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Our stack 145 chips, deep. Position BB, out of position post-flop.\n\nHand Q2 suited is very weak, especially off-suit? Actually suited: both spades, so Q\u26602\u2660. Potential for flush draws, but still low equity. Preflop against a raise, typical action: fold unless you have a reason to call (maybe to defend blind with suited connectors). Q2 suited is not a good defender, especially against a raise from UTG? Not sure where seat 3 is relative to us. Seats: seat 1 (folded), seat 2 (folded), seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised, seat 4 (folded), seat 5 (us). So seat 3 is UTG? Actually we are seat 5 (BB). Seats 1-4 are before us. So seat 3 is the third player to act preflop, after seat 2. So seat 3 is probably \"UTG+1\"? The blinds: seat 4 posted SB, seat 5 posted BB. So seat 1 is under the gun? Actually seat 1 is first to act preflop (UTG). So seat 3 is \"MP\"? Let's map: 8 seats maybe but only 5 seats active? Actually there are 5 seats total. Seat order: 1 (UTG), 2 (UTG+1), 3 (UTG+2?), 4 (SB), 5 (BB). So seat 3 is \"cutoff\"? Not exactly. With 5 players, positions: seat 1 is UTG, seat 2 is MP, seat 3 is CO (cutoff), seat 4 is SB, seat 5 is BB. So DeepSeek-V3.2 is in cutoff. Their raise of 6 is a standard raise. They could be raising wide or tight. Past data: they've raised 6 in two previous hands (hand 3 and 13) and once raised 45 (hand 1). So they sometimes raise big, sometimes small. No other info.\n\nOur hand Q2s is not a good call. The pot odds: need to call 4 to win 9+4=13 pot. So pot odds ~ 4/13 \u2248 30.8%. Our equity vs unknown range is far lower, maybe ~10% or less. So folding is correct.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe need JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand 9h5h in BB, stack 144, blinds 1/2, pot 3. Small blind posted 1, big blind posted 2, amount to call is 1 (to call the small blind). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4). We need to decide based on hand strength, position (BB), stack depth (72 BB, deep). 9h5h is a weak suited connector, not great. In BB, you can limp (call) and see flop cheap. But with 72 BB, we can afford to limp. However, consider opponent seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) in seat 1 is the SB? Actually seat 1 posted SB 1, seat 5 posted BB. So opponent in SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 367 chips (large stack). SB may raise often. But they have already posted SB and not yet acted. It's preflop, after SB posted 1, BB posted 2, now it's SB's turn? Actually order: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then action starts with player left of BB, which is SB (seat 1). So SB's action hasn't occurred yet. The actions list shows only posting, no raises. So it's SB's turn to act, amount to call is 1 (i.e., they need to call the BB's 2? Wait amount to call is 1 meaning they need to put in 1 more to match BB? Actually from BB perspective, amount to call is 1 because they already posted 2, SB posted 1, so to call SB's raise they'd need to call 1? No, SB hasn't acted. In BB, amount to call is the difference between the current bet (SB's bet) and BB's bet. Since SB hasn't bet, the current bet is 1 (SB's blind). BB already put 2, so to call SB they need to put in 0? Actually typical: after blinds, action starts with player after BB. If SB checks (i.e., does not raise), BB can check (i.e., no additional chips). But the system says amount to call: 1. That suggests they consider BB's effective amount to call is 1 to call the SB's blind (i.e., to match the 1). But BB already has 2 in, which is more than SB's 1, so they are already ahead. Usually BB can check. So amount to call 1 seems odd. Possibly the system treats BB's perspective: need to call 1 more to bring total to 3? Not sure. But they gave legal actions: fold, call, raise. So calling would put in 1 chip more, making total 3? That would be a \"check\" effectively? Actually if BB calls 1, they'd be putting 3 total, which is 1 more than SB's 1, so they'd be raising? Not correct.\n\nNevertheless, typical decision: with 9h5h, we can either call (i.e., just check) or raise. Raising is not advisable with such a weak hand. So we likely will call (i.e., just check). So action: call? Or check? Since amount to call is 1, we call. Reason: weak suited, deep stack, want to see flop cheap.\n\nThus output JSON.",

We are in BB, we called small blind preflop, now we have the option to check or raise. Our hand is a low pair (5s) with a flush draw (two hearts). The board is relatively dry. Opponent checked; likely weak hand or maybe draws. We could bet to take pot or raise. Considering stack sizes: we have 71.5 BB, opponent 183 BB. So we have medium stack. We could bet for value and to protect flush draw. But opponent may have Ace-high, etc. A bet of maybe 2-3 chips? Minimum raise to 2 (i.e., raise to 2 total? Actually raise to 2 chips total? The raise amount includes call? Minimum raise to 2 means we must put total 2 chips? Since current pot 4, amount to call 0. So raising to 2 would be a bet of 2 chips. That's a small bet, about half pot. Might be okay. Could also check and see turn. But we have a flush draw, want to build pot. I'd raise to 2 chips. Legal actions include raise.

Blinds 2/4, so big blind 4.\n\nAction: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) posted small blind 2, Seat3 posted big blind 4 (but seat3 is folded? Actually seat3 posted BB 4, then later seat3 fold). Seat4 folded. Seat5 (us) raise to 8 (so we opened 4 over BB? Actually we are BB, we raise to 8 (i.e., 4 more). Then seat1 fold. Seat2 raise to 24 (so they re-raise to 24). Seat3 fold.\n\nNow we face a raise to 24, we have already put 8, so amount to call 16 (to match 24). Minimum raise to 40 (so raise total to 40). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand Ad9h offsuit. In BB vs SB re-raise. SB is Kimi-K2. We have some data: Kimi-K2's raise amounts: 18 (hand1), 6,6,6. So they have raised small amounts often (6) maybe wide range. But they also raised 18 once. Not a lot of data. Our hand is Ace-9 offsuit, decent but not premium. In BB vs SB 3-bet, typical ranges: SB's 3-bet range maybe wide, but with 34 BB we can consider call or fold. Stack depth moderate. 24 is 6 BB (since big blind 4, 24/4=6 BB). That's a sizable 3-bet.\n\nOur hand Ad9 offsuit is about 8%? Actually A9 offsuit is around 12% vs random. In BB vs SB 3-bet, it's marginal. Usually you would fold A9o unless you have good implied odds or you think opponent is loose. Our stack is 34 BB, not huge but enough.\n\nWe also have pot 36 (blinds+our raise). If we call 16, pot will be 36+16+16? Actually after SB raises to 24, pot = 36 (original) + 24 (SB) + 8 (our raise) = 68? Wait timeline: Preflop: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, pot = 6. We raise to 8 (total), so we put 4 extra (since we already have 4). So we add 4, pot = 10. SB folds? Actually seat1 fold, SB raise to 24, adding 22 more (since they already put 2). So pot becomes 10 + 22 = 32? Wait compute: Starting pot after blinds = 6. Our raise to 8: we add 4 (so total contributed by us = 8). Pot = 6 + 4 = 10. SB raise to 24: they add 22 (since already 2). Pot = 10 + 22 = 32. Then we need to call 16 to match 24 (we have 8 already). So if we call, we add 16, pot = 48. So calling gives us 48 pot for 16 call = 3:1 pot odds, 33% needed. Our hand equity vs unknown range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline.\n\nGiven limited data, maybe fold. Also we have 34 BB, preserving stack is important. I'd likely fold A9o to a 3-bet from SB.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise 4 more). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: pocket pairs low, vulnerable to overcards. In early position, typical strategy is to fold unless deep stacks and implied odds for set mining. Stack 35 BB, not super deep but can consider set mining. However with 35 BB you could call 4 to see flop, implied odds maybe enough. But also there are 3 opponents left (positions after us: CO, BTN, SB? Actually UTG seat5, seats 6-8 maybe not listed; we have only 5 players? seats 1-5 only. So after us, seats 1-4 are before us? Wait seat numbers: seat1,2,3,4,5. Position UTG seat5 indicates we are first to act preflop (under the gun) because seats 1-4 are after us? Actually typical order: seat1 is small blind? But they posted sb seat3 and bb seat4. So seat3 is SB, seat4 is BB. So seat5 is UTG (under the gun) meaning first to act after blinds. So we are first to act preflop.\n\nThus we will face 3 opponents after us (seats 1,2,3? seat3 already sb posted but can act later). So raising could be risky. With pocket threes, typical play is to limp (call) in early position in deep stack tournament? Many players limp with low pairs to set mine, but also could raise to isolate. However raising may get re-raised by stronger hands.\n\nGiven we have 35 BB, calling 4 is 1 BB, pot odds: 4 to call for 6+4=10 pot, 40% pot odds, set probability ~12% (12% chance to hit set on flop). So not profitable purely on pot odds. But implied odds from opponents' stacks could be decent, but early position and many players may call, reducing implied odds.\n\nBetter to fold? Many players fold low pairs UTG. In tournament, preserving stack is important. I think folding is prudent.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll fold.\n\nProvide reasoning."

Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise 4 more). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: pocket pairs low, vulnerable to overcards. In early position, typical strategy is to fold unless deep stacks and implied odds for set mining. Stack 35 BB, not super deep but can consider set mining. However with 35 BB you could call 4 to see flop, implied odds maybe enough. But also there are 3 opponents left (positions after us: CO, BTN, SB? Actually UTG seat5, seats 6-8 maybe not listed; we have only 5 players? seats 1-5 only. So after us, seats 1-4 are before us? Wait seat numbers: seat1,2,3,4,5. Position UTG seat5 indicates we are first to act preflop (under the gun) because seats 1-4 are after us? Actually typical order: seat1 is small blind? But they posted sb seat3 and bb seat4. So seat3 is SB, seat4 is BB. So seat5 is UTG (under the gun) meaning first to act after blinds. So we are first to act preflop.\n\nThus we will face 3 opponents after us (seats 1,2,3? seat3 already sb posted but can act later). So raising could be risky. With pocket threes, typical play is to limp (call) in early position in deep stack tournament? Many players limp with low pairs to set mine, but also could raise to isolate. However raising may get re-raised by stronger hands.\n\nGiven we have 35 BB, calling 4 is 1 BB, pot odds: 4 to call for 6+4=10 pot, 40% pot odds, set probability ~12% (12% chance to hit set on flop). So not profitable purely on pot odds. But implied odds from opponents' stacks could be decent, but early position and many players may call, reducing implied odds.\n\nBetter to fold? Many players fold low pairs UTG. In tournament, preserving stack is important. I think folding is prudent.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Against short stack raise, we could call and see flop, but risk being dominated. Also tournament stage? Not given.\n\nWe could raise (re-raise) but min raise is 12 (total). That would be a 3-bet to 12, which is small. Might be considered a squeeze? But opponent is short, likely to call or shove all-in. If we raise to 12, they might call or go all-in (they have 30 left). Could be dangerous.\n\nBetter to consider calling with TQ offsuit? It's a decent hand, but against a short stack who may be stealing, we could call and see flop, but risk being out of position post-flop (we'll be out of position after flop? Actually we are BTN, after flop we will be in position relative to them). So calling is okay.\n\nPot odds: need to call 8 to win pot 14+8=22? Actually pot currently 14 (SB+BB) plus raise 8 = 22? Wait pot before action: SB 2 + BB 4 = 6? Actually pot includes blinds: 2+4=6. Then raise to 8 adds 8 from MiniMax, making pot 6+8=14? The description says pot:14 chips before action. So after call 8, pot becomes 22. So we call 8 to win 22, odds 8/22 = 36%. Hand equity vs opponent's likely range (short stack stealing) maybe around 45%?

So no straight. Flush draw? Two hearts on board, we have none, so no flush. Pair? We have Ace high, no pair. So hand is weak. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised preflop to 8 (from SB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 34 chips, likely short stack). He is short stack 34 chips, 8 raise is 2/4 blinds? Actually blinds 2/4, so raise to 8 is 2x big blind. He has 34 chips, about 8.5 BB. He is short; could be shoving soon. He bet 4 on flop (half pot). Pot now 30, bet 4, we can call 4. Our stack 125, so we can call. Need evaluate opponent tendencies: short stack may be trying to steal, maybe has overpair like AA, KK, or suited connectors. Board has Ace, so if he has Ace, he'd have top pair, maybe bet. Could be bluff? He raised preflop from SB with 34 chips; maybe he had a wide range (any pair, suited connectors, A-x). He called our call preflop (we called his raise). So he is willing to see flop. On flop he checks, we check? Actually seat 2 (BB) checks, then seat 4 (MiniMax) bets 4. So we need to decide call, raise, fold.\n\nGiven hand is weak, likely fold. But consider pot odds: pot 30, bet 4, we need to call 4 to win 34 (pot+bet). Pot odds ~ 4/34 = 11.8% needed. Our equity with Ace high vs unknown short stack range? Likely low. So folding is correct.\n\nBut maybe we could raise as a bluff? Our stack 125, we could raise to 8 min, but opponent short stack might call all-in? He only has 34 chips left, after bet 4 he has 30 left. If we raise to 8, he could call 4 more (to 8 total) maybe all-in? Actually min raise to 8 means total bet 8, so raise additional 4, making total bet 8. He would need to call 4 more (from 30 left) to 8. He could call and still have chips left. Raising could be a bluff, but we have weak hand and short stack may have strong. Probably fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

In a tournament early-ish with 30 BB, UTG raising is possible but many players would fold. However 8K is not a premium hand; many players would fold to a raise. Could also consider calling the big blind (4) to see flop cheap. But position is early, risk of being out of position.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: we have two players left: Seat2 posted SB (2) and Seat3 posted BB (4). Actually seat2 is SB with 2 chips? Wait SB is 2, they posted 2 chips, seat3 is BB posted 4 chips. So we are facing a raise? No, we are facing amount to call 4 (the BB). So it's preflop, it's our turn, we can call 4 to see flop. The legal actions are fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 119, others have 357,241,268. So we have shortest stack.\n\nRaising with 8K could be a steal attempt, but being UTG is not a steal; the blinds are small relative to stack. If we raise to minimum 8 (i.e., total 8 chips), that's a raise of 4 over BB. That would be a 2x BB raise. Not a big raise. Might get called by both SB and BB.\n\nGiven our hand is not strong, maybe we should fold. But we also have a short stack; we may need to pick spots to pick up chips.\n\nWe could call and see flop cheaply, hoping to hit a straight or pair. 8K is decent but not great.\n\nI think best is to fold preflop.\n\nBut we could also consider calling to see flop and maybe steal later. However being out of position UTG, postflop play is tough.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually need 3-5-6-7-8? Not. So our hand is a pair of sixes, currently behind Q high. Opponent seat 2 raised preflop to 12 (3bb). We called. So they likely have a range: maybe broadway, suited connectors, etc. On flop they haven't acted yet (we are BB, they are in seat 2 UTG? Actually seat 2 is after seat1 folded, seat2 raised preflop. Now flop, it's seat2's turn first (since they were preflop raiser). The pot is 26 chips (2+4+12+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 2 (seat3), BB 4, raise to 12 (seat2) means they put 12 total? Actually raise to 12 means they added 8 more after BB 4. So total contributions: seat3 2, seat5 4, seat2 12, seat5 called 8? Wait seat5 called 8 (the raise amount is 12, they need to call 8 more). So seat5 contributed 4+8 =12. So total pot after preflop: seat3 2, seat5 12, seat2 12 = 26. Yes pot 26.\n\nNow flop Qc5d4d, no action yet. We have 113 chips left. Opponent stack 219. They have position (UTG?) maybe early but now they act first. Our hand is a medium pair, not strong. Likely we should check and possibly fold to a bet. If they bet, we can consider calling if pot odds favorable? Pot 26, bet maybe 12-20. Our pair of sixes is likely behind many hands: Qx, 5x, 4x, straight draws, flush draws (diamonds). So not good. So best to check and likely fold if they bet.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8 (meaning raise to 8? Actually raise to total 8? But we already have 0 to call. Minimum raise to 8 means we can raise to 8 total? That would be a raise of 8 chips. That's small. Could consider a small raise as a bluff? But we have only 6's, not a good bluff on this board with Q high. Opponent may have Q, 5, 4, diamonds, etc. Raising may get called and we lose. Better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have SB with Js As (Ace-Jack suited). Stack 111 chips, blinds 2/4, effective stacks smallish. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 10 (so 2.5x big blind). We need to decide fold/call/raise. AJ suited is a strong hand, especially in short stack. Effective stack: opponent's stack unknown? Opponent seat 3 has 272 chips. Our stack 111, so we are short stack relative to them. We are in SB, so after posting 2, we face 8 to call, min raise to 16 (i.e., raise additional 6). Considering tournament, we have 27.8 BB, we can either call and see flop, or raise all-in? Our stack 111 chips, raise to 111 would be all-in. Minimum raise to 16 is small relative to our stack, but a raise might isolate. With AJ suited, we could raise to maybe 30-40 to apply pressure. However we are short stack; calling 8 leaves us 103 left, still decent. But if we call and lose, we lose 8, still have 103. Might be okay. However we have AJ suited, a premium hand. Raising could get more value if they have a weaker hand, but they already raised to 10, maybe they have a wide range. In SB, we can also consider re-raising all-in to leverage fold equity. Opponent's raise size 10 is small; they may be opening a wide range from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, position unknown but likely UTG? Table seats: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 (BB), seat 2 folded, seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 5 is us (SB). So DeepSeek is UTG (or early). Their raise size is 10 (2.5 BB). That suggests a standard raise. With AJ suited, we can either call or 3-bet. Our stack 111, we could 3-bet to maybe 30-40 to isolate. But risk of being 4-bet all-in? Opponent could 4-bet all-in, but they have 272 chips, can cover us. However they might not 4-bet with weaker hands.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 27.8 BB, not extremely short but can afford a push. AJ suited is a good hand to go all-in in short stack. Many players would push with AJ suited at 28 BB. So I think push all-in (raise to 111). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to our stack (all-in). Reasoning: maximize fold equity, avoid playing postflop with short stack, strong hand.\n\nThus action: raise to 111.",

In BB vs raise from UTG? Actually seat2 is likely UTG? Not sure. But we are BB, only opponent in hand (others folded). So it's a heads-up pot. In heads-up, range is wide. 3bb raise from opponent, we can call with many hands. T6s is marginal. Considering stack depth 30 BB, we can call.\n\nWe might also consider raising (3-bet) to isolate. But T6s is not a strong 3-bet candidate; 3-bet range typically strong like AQs, AK, etc. So likely call.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 often raises 12 preflop (hand #31, #35, #36). So they are raising 12 often, maybe wide. They also sometimes bet on flop with 8, 18, etc. Not much info. So we can call.\n\nPot odds: To call 8 into pot 18+8 = 26 after call? Actually current pot 18, opponent raised to 12, so pot now 18+12 = 30? Wait initial pot 18 includes blinds 2+4+? Actually blinds 2+4 =6, plus maybe antes? Not. So pot 18 before raise? The pot includes SB 2, BB 4, plus maybe other? Actually they listed pot 18 chips. Then opponent raises to 12 (adds 8 more). So pot now 18+8 =26? Let's compute: Starting pot 6, after raise to 12, opponent adds 8, pot 14. But they list pot 18 maybe includes something else. Not crucial. Call 8 for pot ~26, odds ~30%? So need equity >30% to be profitable. T6s vs unknown raise range maybe around 30%? Might be okay.\n\nThus call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: Jc As Jd (pair of Jacks, Ace high). Our hand: Ts 6s (Ten of spades, Six of spades). So we have a gutshot? Actually board: J J A. We have Ten spade, which gives us a straight draw? No, need QK? Not. We have a backdoor flush possibility (spades: board has no spade). So we have nothing: just high card Ten, not a pair. So we are currently with a weak hand.\n\nPot is 26 chips. Our stack 115, we have 115 total, but we already put 4 (bb) + call 8 = 12? Actually preflop we called 8 (big blind 4 + call 8? Wait: raise to 12 by seat 2, we called 8 to match 12 (since we already have 4 in blind). So we have 12 in pot? The pot after preflop: blinds 2+4=6, plus raise 12 (seat2 adds 12?), seat2 raise 12 means they put 12 total (including big blind?). Usually raise to 12 means total bet 12. So pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (raise) = 18? Then call 8 adds 8 (since we already have 4). So pot becomes 26, matches given.\n\nNow flop: Jc As Jd. Opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop, now we have flop. We need to decide.\n\nWe have no pair, board is paired Jacks with Ace kicker. Opponent likely has strong hand: maybe AK, AQ, AJ, AA, JJ, or a set? Actually board has two Jacks, one Ace. So opponent could have Jx for trips, or AA for top pair top kicker, or AK for top pair Ace? Wait board: Jc As Jd. So top pair is Ace (if they have Ace). Actually they could have As? But As is on board, so they can't have Ace of spades. They could have Ace of hearts/diamonds/clubs. So they could have Ace high pair.\n\nWe have no pair, no draw. Likely we are behind. We have 0 equity.\n\nWe could consider folding, but we have already called preflop and we have 115 chips, but we might want to try a bluff? However board is paired, a scare card for opponent? Actually Jacks are scary for us but not for opponent. Our hand is weak; a bluff might be possible if opponent is weak and can fold, but we have no fold equity perhaps.\n\nWe need to check if we have any chance to improve on turn/river: we could get a straight? Board: J A J. To get straight we need KQ or QK? Actually need Ten-J-Q-K? We have Ten, so if turn is Q and river K we could make straight? Actually we need Ten-J-Q-K? That's 10-J-Q-K, need also? That's 4 cards; we need 5 cards, we have Ten, board J, we need Q and K and maybe something else. Not promising.\n\nWe could get flush if spades appear 3 more times: we have two spades in hand, need 3 spades on board. Unlikely.\n\nThus best is to check (since amount to call is 0). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since no bet, we can check. Checking is safe.\n\nBut maybe we could raise as a bluff? Minimum raise to 8 (total). That would be 8 into 26 pot, pot odds 26:8 = 3.25:1, we would need equity > 23.5% to be profitable. Our equity is near 0. So not good.\n\nThus we should check.\n\nProvide JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with Ts6s. Board: Jc As Jd. So board is paired Jacks, with Ace high. Our hand: Ten of spades and six of spades. So we have a gutshot? Actually we have a straight draw? Board: A J J. Our Ts gives us a gutshot straight draw to QK? Let's see possible straights: Ten with J? Actually need 9 to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Not possible. Ten with J: we have T, board J J A. The only possible straight is 9-10-J-Q-K, but we need 9 and Q and K. Not there. So no straight draw. We have a backdoor flush draw? Suited spades: board has clubs and diamonds, no spades, so we have 2 spades, could get flush on turn/river if two more spades appear. Not strong.\n\nOur hand is currently just a ten high, no pair, no draw. The board is very strong: top pair Aces, Jacks pair. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 12 (from SB? Actually seat2 is in SB? Let's see: Seats: 1 Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded). Seat 2 Kimi-K2 - 213 chips. So seat2 is probably SB (since seat3 posted sb 2). Wait preflop actions: Seat3 post_sb 2, seat5 post_bb 4. So seat3 is SB, seat5 is BB. So seat2 is UTG? Actually seat2 raised 12 after seat5 called. So seat2 is probably UTG or maybe CO? Not important.\n\nWe called preflop with Ts6s, which is a weak hand. Likely we are out of position (we are BB, after flop we are first to act). Opponent bet 20 into pot 46, now pot will be 66 if we call. Pot odds: need 20 to win 66 (including opponent's bet?), Actually pot before bet is 46, opponent bets 20 making pot 66 (46+20). Need to call 20 to win 66 => 30% equity needed. Our hand likely far less than 30% vs opponent's range. Opponent's range on flop likely includes strong hands: top pair Aces, Jacks, two pair, sets, maybe draws. Our hand has basically zero equity unless we hit a spade flush or maybe a straight on later streets (unlikely). So folding is correct.\n\nCheck if any reason to call? Maybe opponent is bluffing? But board is scary. Opponent raised preflop, so likely strong. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Jd Qh in BB, 12.4 BB stack (99 chips). Blinds 4/8, so effective stack is about 12 BB. Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (the big blind?). Actually seat1 posted sb 4? Wait actions: Seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind), seat1 post_bb 8 (big blind). So seat1 is big blind, we are in BB? Actually position says BB seat5, but actions show seat5 posted sb. Contradiction: The hand description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but then actions: seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind). Probably mislabel but we treat as small blind? Actually seat5 is us, we posted small blind 4. Seat1 posted big blind 8. So we are SB, not BB. Our stack 99 includes the 4 we posted, so effective after posting SB is 95 remaining.\n\nWe face amount to call 4 (to match big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to total 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand Jd Qh is decent suited? Not suited (Jd Qh). Offsuit QJ is decent for a short stack? In early position (SB) vs BB only? Actually only two players left: us SB and BB (Kimi). So it's a heads-up preflop. With 12 BB, QJ offsuit is a decent hand, but we are short stack; we could consider a raise or call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi often raises preflop with amounts 6,12,24,18. In heads-up? The data not specific. But they have raised frequently. So they may be aggressive. As SB we can either raise to isolate or call to see flop cheap.\n\nOur stack: 99 chips, 12 BB. If we call 4, we will be 8 BB effective (since BB 8 + 4 call = 12 total pot). After call, pot will be 12+4 call? Actually pot currently 12 (SB 4 + BB 8). Call 4 adds to pot 4, making pot 16. Then flop effective stacks: we have 95 chips left (99-4). After call we have 91 left. Opponent will have 291 chips (assuming they haven't acted). Actually they posted 8, still have 317-8=309? Wait they have 325 chips total; posted 8, so 317 left.\n\nIf we raise to 16 (total), we add 12 more (since we already posted 4). That would be a raise of 12, making total bet 16. Opponent would need to call 8 more (since they already have 8 in pot). That would be a raise of 8. Minimum raise to 16 is correct.\n\nRaising to 16 would be 2x BB (since BB is 8). That's a standard raise. With 12 BB stack, raising to 16 is okay. If opponent re-raises (3-bet), they'd need to have enough chips.\n\nGiven we have QJ offsuit, we could raise to isolate, but we are short. If opponent is aggressive, they may 3-bet, we could be in trouble.\n\nCalling is also an option: see flop cheap, we have position post-flop (SB is first to act preflop, but after flop, SB is first to act? Actually in heads-up, SB is dealer, so after flop SB is first to act. So we would be out of position. So raising could give us initiative.\n\nGiven short stack, we might want to go all-in? Not allowed? Minimum raise to 16, we could raise all-in (99). But legal actions allow raise to any amount up to stack. We could go all-in to put pressure. However, with QJ offsuit, all-in may be too much risk.\n\nConsider tournament: 12 BB is short; we might want to accumulate chips. QJ offsuit is about 12% equity vs random hands. Might be okay to raise to 16 and try to win small pot. If opponent folds, we pick up 12 chips (increase stack). If they call, we are in a flop with 12 BB effective. Might be okay.\n\nThus I think raise to 16.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #45 flop. Position BB, we raised preflop to 16, opponent (Seat1) called 8 (so they put 8 more? Actually preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then BB raised to 16 (so added 8), Seat1 called 8 (so they put 8 more). So pot 32 (makes sense: SB 4, BB 8, BB raise to 16 total 16, seat1 call 8 extra? Actually pot: SB 4, BB 8 (big blind) then BB raises to 16 (so adds 8 more, total BB 16), seat1 calls 8 (so they put 8). So total contributions: SB 4, BB 16, seat1 8 = 28? plus maybe some miscalc, but pot shown 32. Might include the blind amounts? Anyway pot 32.\n\nWe have Jd Qh, board 3c 6s Ks. So we have overcards, gutshot straight draw? With J and Q, we have open-ended? Board: 3-6-K. Our hand: QJ gives us gutshot to a straight? 3-4-5-6-7? Actually we have 3,6,K. With J and Q, we could make straight if a 5 and 4? Let's see combos: Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 4 and 5). Our JQ not help. Also 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7-10). Not relevant. So no straight draw. We have two overcards to K (Q and J). Could make top pair if K pairs? Actually K is on board, we have no pair. So currently we have nothing, just two overcards.\n\nOpponent seat1: we have recall: they have been folding a lot preflop; in hand 30 they bet flop 4 and then folded. Hand 39 they raised preflop 12 and then folded (maybe after? Actually they raised then folded? Not sure). They seem somewhat passive, maybe can fold to aggression.\n\nNow it's our turn on flop after we raised preflop and opponent called. On flop, no bets yet. Amount to call 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total? Actually raise to total amount 8? Since pot 32, but min raise is 8). We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak. With only 87 chips stack, 10.9 BB, we are short-stacked but not ultra. Pot is 32, our stack 87. If we raise, we could commit chips. We could try to steal the pot with a continuation bet, representing strong hand. Opponent seems passive and may fold to c-bet. So raising (c-bet) could win pot 32 for maybe 8 chips (size). That's a good % of pot. If they call, we go to turn with weak hand; but we could then evaluate.\n\nGiven our stack, we can also consider shoving all-in? Minimum raise is 8, but we could go all-in if we want. But probably just raise to 8 (or maybe 12) as a c-bet.\n\nWe need to decide between check and raise. Check gives free cards and likely opponent will bet? They might check back. They are passive; they might check, then we could call? Not good.\n\nThus raise to 8 (or maybe 12) as continuation bet. Since min raise is 8, raising to 8 is small but okay. Pot odds: they need to call 8 to win 40 pot (32+8). That's 20% needed. Overcards have about 12% chance to pair top pair (Q or J) on turn? Actually turn unknown. Probability to improve? Not great. But we can win immediately.\n\nThus raise to 8.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Let's see: board: A K 6 3. With J and Q, we have inside straight draw: 10 would give 10-J-Q-K-A? Actually need 10 to make straight: 10-J-Q-K-A uses A,K,Q,J,10. Yes we have Q,J, need 10. So gutshot open-ended? Actually only 10 works (and also maybe 9? 9-10-J-Q-K? No board has A, not part. So only 10). So we have one card outs for straight (10). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds? Board: 3c (clubs), 6s (spades), Ks (spades), Ah (hearts). So two spades on board, we have Jd Qh (diamond, heart). No flush draw.\n\nOur stack 79 chips, pot 48, we are in BB (small stack). Opponent seat1 Kimi-K2 has 309 chips, bigger stack. Actions: preflop we raised to 16 (big blind 8, we posted 4 sb? Wait we are BB seat5, posted 8. Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 4? That seems weird: seat5 is BB but posted sb 4? Maybe they swapped? Anyway we raised to 16, opponent called 8. Flop: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So pot after flop: initial pot 8+8+16? Let's compute: Preflop: we posted 4 sb? Actually seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So we are SB? But position says BB. Might be confusion. Anyway pot after preflop: we raised 16 (so additional 12 beyond 4?), opponent called 8 (matching our raise). So contributions: we put 4+16=20? Actually raise 16 means total 16? Usually raise to 16 includes initial 4? Hard. But pot after preflop likely 4 (our sb) +8 (bb) +16 (our raise) +8 (opponent call) =36? Then flop bet 8 each, adds 16, pot 52? But given pot after flop is 48. So maybe numbers differ. Anyway pot is 48 now after flop betting. Turn action: we have amount to call 0, meaning we are first to act on turn. Minimum raise to 8. Legal: fold, check, raise. We can check (no bet). Should we bet? Evaluate opponent's tendencies: we have recall of opponent's raises preflop always 12 (small raises). No info on turn betting. But they called our flop bet of 8, which is small. Their range likely includes A-high combos, maybe Kx, QJ? They have Ace on board, so they may have A? Could be a pair of A's, or Kx, or maybe a straight draw like QJ? But we have QJ.\n\nOur hand: currently two overcards, gutshot, not strong. With short stack 79 chips, pot 48, if we bet and get called we could be in tough spot. Check maybe.\n\nConsider tournament: we are short stack (9.9 BB). Might want to find a spot to double up. Here we have some equity but not great. Opponent likely has a strong Ace or King. If we bet, we risk being called and then we may have to fold on river if missed. Check could induce opponent to bet, we could call maybe? But we have limited stack.\n\nIf we check, opponent may bet with Ace or King, we could call if we think we have decent equity? Our equity vs AK? We have JQ vs AK: we have two overcards, gutshot 10. Equity maybe ~20%? Not great to call a bet. Better to maybe raise to put pressure? Minimum raise 8, which is small relative to pot (48). Raising to 8 means total bet 8? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, not additional. Since amount to call 0, raise to 8 means bet 8. That's same as flop bet size. Could raise larger, but min raise is 8, we could raise to any amount up to our stack. Could go all-in 79? That's a big shove. With 9.9 BB, maybe push? But our hand not strong enough for all-in.\n\nBetter to check and see if opponent bets, we can decide. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: check. So output"

Board: 3c (clubs), 6s (spades), Ks (spades), Ah (hearts). So two spades on board, we have Jd Qh (diamond, heart). No flush draw.\n\nOur stack 79 chips, pot 48, we are in BB (small stack). Opponent seat1 Kimi-K2 has 309 chips, bigger stack. Actions: preflop we raised to 16 (big blind 8, we posted 4 sb? Wait we are BB seat5, posted 8. Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 4? That seems weird: seat5 is BB but posted sb 4? Maybe they swapped? Anyway we raised to 16, opponent called 8. Flop: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So pot after flop: initial pot 8+8+16? Let's compute: Preflop: we posted 4 sb? Actually seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So we are SB? But position says BB. Might be confusion. Anyway pot after preflop: we raised 16 (so additional 12 beyond 4?), opponent called 8 (matching our raise). So contributions: we put 4+16=20? Actually raise 16 means total 16? Usually raise to 16 includes initial 4? Hard. But pot after preflop likely 4 (our sb) +8 (bb) +16 (our raise) +8 (opponent call) =36? Then flop bet 8 each, adds 16, pot 52? But given pot after flop is 48. So maybe numbers differ. Anyway pot is 48 now after flop betting. Turn action: we have amount to call 0, meaning we are first to act on turn. Minimum raise to 8. Legal: fold, check, raise. We can check (no bet). Should we bet? Evaluate opponent's tendencies: we have recall of opponent's raises preflop always 12 (small raises). No info on turn betting. But they called our flop bet of 8, which is small. Their range likely includes A-high combos, maybe Kx, QJ? They have Ace on board, so they may have A? Could be a pair of A's, or Kx, or maybe a straight draw like QJ? But we have QJ.\n\nOur hand: currently two overcards, gutshot, not strong. With short stack 79 chips, pot 48, if we bet and get called we could be in tough spot. Check maybe.\n\nConsider tournament: we are short stack (9.9 BB). Might want to find a spot to double up. Here we have some equity but not great. Opponent likely has a strong Ace or King. If we bet, we risk being called and then we may have to fold on river if missed. Check could induce opponent to bet, we could call maybe? But we have limited stack.\n\nIf we check, opponent may bet with Ace or King, we could call if we think we have decent equity? Our equity vs AK? We have JQ vs AK: we have two overcards, gutshot 10. Equity maybe ~20%? Not great to call a bet. Better to maybe raise to put pressure? Minimum raise 8, which is small relative to pot (48). Raising to 8 means total bet 8? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, not additional. Since amount to call 0, raise to 8 means bet 8. That's same as flop bet size. Could raise larger, but min raise is 8, we could raise to any amount up to our stack. Could go all-in 79? That's a big shove. With 9.9 BB, maybe push? But our hand not strong enough for all-in.\n\nBetter to check and see if opponent bets, we can decide. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: check. So output",

Board has A K 6 3. Our hand J Q gives open-ended straight draw? Let's see possible straights: need 10 and 9 for straight (10-J-Q-K-A) that's a Broadway straight requiring 10 and 9. We have J and Q, missing 10 and 9. Not open-ended because need both. So we have gutshot? Actually need both 10 and 9, that's two cards, not a draw. So currently we have just high cards, no pair, no flush draw (two diamonds? board has none, we have Qh, Jd, so no). So we have basically nothing, just Ace-high (board Ace). Opponent bet 78 into pot 126+? Actually pot before turn action: after flop bet 8 and call 8, pot = preflop: 16+8 =24, plus flop 8+8 =16 => total 40? Wait compute: Preflop: we raised 16 (including SB 4? Actually we posted 4, then raise to 16 total? So we put 16? Usually raise to 16 means we put total 16, so net contribution 12 after posting 4. Opponent called 8 (big blind). So pot after preflop = 4+8+16 =28? Let's not worry. After flop bet 8 and call 8, pot adds 16 => pot maybe 44. Turn check then opponent bets 78. So pot now 44+78 =122? Actually they bet 78, so total pot after bet = 44+78 =122 (plus our check 0). So amount to call 78, pot odds: call 78 to win 122? Actually if we call, pot becomes 122+78=200? Wait we need correct: current pot before opponent bet = 44? Let's compute precisely: Preflop: SB 4 posted, BB 8 posted. Then we raise to 16 (so we add 12 more). Opponent calls 8 (so adds 8). So contributions: SB 4+12=16, BB 8. Pot = 24. Flop: we bet 8, opponent calls 8. So add 16 => pot = 40. Turn: we check, opponent bets 78. So pot now 40+78=118 (including his bet). Amount to call 78, total pot after call would be 118+78=196. So pot odds = 78/196 \u2248 0.398, need ~40% equity. Our hand has basically zero equity vs opponent's range. Need to consider opponent's range: He is Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 231, after bet 78 (which is about 62% of his stack). He is the SB? Actually seat1 posted BB 8, seat5 is BB? Wait seat5 is us BB, seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted BB 8, seat5 posted SB 4. So seat1 is big blind, we are small blind. Preflop we raised, he called. So on turn, he bets big (78) after board A K 6 3. That suggests he likely has strong hand: maybe AK, AQ, KQ, maybe a set? Board has K, A, 6,3. No pair on board besides maybe K? Actually board has K, A, 6,3. He could have AK, AA, KK, maybe a straight draw? Not likely. Could be a bluff? But bet is large, likely value.\n\nOur hand JQ is weak. Should fold. But maybe consider implied odds? No draws. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Actually seat2 is maybe under the gun) called 8 (just called). So pot is 20 (4+8+8). No raise yet. We're in BB with 4-4, a small pocket pair. With short stack 8.9 BB, we could consider a raise to try to steal or get value. But the opponent called from seat2 (maybe early position) with 251 chips, likely a decent stack. Pocket fours are not great for a steal from BB vs a caller who already called. But we could also check and see a flop cheap. However with 8.9 BB, we could consider a shove? Minimum raise is 16 (so raise to 16 total). That would be a raise of 8 more (since we already have 8 in). That would be a raise to 16 total, putting 8 more chips. That would be a small raise, not a shove. Could also raise more, but legal raise min is 16; we can raise higher up to our stack 71. With short stack, often push/fold. But we are already in BB with a medium small pair; raising to 16 may get called by a weak hand, but we risk being outdrawn.\n\nGiven stack 71, we could also go all-in (71) to try to double up. However opponent already called 8; they could have a wide range (maybe they have a hand like A2, etc). Pocket fours vs that range is about 50% equity? Actually vs random hand, pocket pair 4s vs random is about 55% preflop. So a shove could be profitable.\n\nBut we have a small blind posted 4, not in action. Actually seat1 folded, seat2 called, seat3 folded. So only seat2 is left. So it's us vs seat2. With 71 chips vs 251 chips, a shove is a classic short stack move. Minimum raise to 16 is not a shove; we can raise to 71 (all-in). That's likely best.\n\nThus action: raise to 71 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed.

Need to consider hand strength: 7c Tc off-suit, not great. In BB, short stack ~11 BB. Raise from early position (seat2) suggests strength. 7T is marginal. With 11 BB, could consider a shove if hand decent. But 7T is not a shoving hand from early position, especially against a raise of 24 (3 BB). However, we are short, but not that short. Call would leave us with 67 chips, still 8.4 BB. Could we fold? Likely fold, as 7T offsuit is not good enough to call a raise from early position with short stack. Could we raise? Not advisable; raising would be a 3-bet to 40 (i.e., additional 20). That is a big commitment. Not good.\n\nThus fold. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises to 20 (so raise to 20 total). Amount to call is 16 (since SB already posted 4, need 16 more to match 20). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise at least to 32 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: 8d6d is a suited connector, decent for short stack maybe can go all-in if raise is big enough. But we have 87 chips, 10.9 BB, raise to 20 is 2.5 BB (since big blind 8). Our stack is 87, we could call 16 (2 BB) and still have 71 chips left. Could also raise all-in (87) but minimum raise is 32, we could raise to 32 (4 BB) or go all-in.\n\nConsider opponent DeepSeek-V3.2's behavior: from recall, they have raised 10 (small) in hand 37, raised 40 in hand 39 (big), otherwise fold a lot. They also called a 4 (hand 44) and bet 8 on flop after calling. They also checked and folded flop in hand 47. So they are somewhat variable; they sometimes raise big, sometimes fold. Not much data.\n\nOur hand 8d6d is marginal. In short stack, we could consider a shove (all-in) to try to steal blinds? But there is a raise already from opponent, so it's a 3-way? Actually only SB and the raiser (DeepSeek) plus BB (who posted 8 but hasn't acted yet? Wait order: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then DeepSeek (seat 3) raises to 20. In SB, we act first (since SB is after BB? Actually order preflop: after blinds, action starts with UTG (seat left of BB). But here only players are SB (seat5), BB (seat1), and seat3 (DeepSeek). The order: UTG would be seat2 (folded), then seat3 (DeepSeek) acts, raising. Then action continues clockwise to seat4 (folded), seat5 (SB) acts, then seat1 (BB) acts. So SB is next to act after raise. So we can call or raise.\n\nGiven we have a short stack, but not ultra short. 8d6d is not a premium hand. Typically we would fold to a raise unless we have a good chance to double up. Could consider a 3-bet (raise) to isolate and go all-in? Raising to 32 would be a 4 BB raise, still less than our stack. Could also go all-in (87) to apply pressure. But opponent's raise to 20 is only 2.5 BB; they might be trying to steal or just opening with a wide range. Our 8d6d can flop well, but we risk being dominated.\n\nStack depth: effective stack is 87 (our stack) vs opponent's 252. So if we go all-in and they call, we could double up to ~339. That's a good move if we have decent equity vs their range. What is their range? With 2.5 BB raise, could be wide: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, maybe even some weaker. 8d6d is decent against that.\n\nBut also we have a blind already posted; we are short stack, maybe we should shove to try to get chips.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 87 chips, others have 341, 279, 252. We are short stack, need to survive. So a shove could be appropriate if hand has decent equity vs opponent's raising range. 8d6d suited has about 30% equity vs random (maybe 30-35%). Against a raising range of maybe 20% of hands, equity maybe ~30%. That could be enough to shove.\n\nBut we also have the BB behind who hasn't acted yet. If we call 16, BB could raise or call. If we raise all-in, BB could fold or call. Not sure.\n\nGiven we have a short stack and marginal hand, I think best is to go all-in (raise to 87) to maximize chance of doubling up. However need to ensure legal raise: minimum raise to 32, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So raise_to 87.\n\nThus decision: raise (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, need to accumulate, hand has decent suited connector equity, opponent's raise is small, we can apply pressure.\n\nLet's produce"

Raising as a bluff is risky against opponents who have shown willingness to raise preflop. With only 14.9 BB, preserving stack is priority, so folding is the safest choice.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #54 preflop, BTN 8c7d, stack 119 (14.9 BB). Blinds 4/8, SB seat1 posted 4, BB seat2 posted 8. So pot 12. Action: we are facing BB 8 (already posted) and SB 4. Actually we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, action is on us to act first preflop (since it's BTN). The amount to call is 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength: 8c7d suited? No, 8c and 7d are unsuited (clubs and diamonds). So offsuit connectors, low. Not a premium hand. In early tournament with 14.9 BB, short stackish but not ultra short. 8c7d off-suit is a marginal hand. As BTN, we have position but not a strong hand. Options: call (8) to see flop for cheap speculation. Raise? Could be a steal attempt, but the blinds are small relative to stack (SB 4, BB 8). Our raise to 16 would be 2 BB raise (since big blind is 8). That's a standard raise size (2 BB). With 8c7d offsuit, raising is not typical; could be a bluff if we think opponents are tight. But we have some stack; calling is cheap and we can see flop.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: seat1 (SB) and seat2 (BB). Look at recall: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raises amounts: often small raises (6, 12). But they are SB, maybe they raise from SB sometimes. But we have no info on their fold to raises. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raises amounts: 6, 12, 24, etc. So both may be aggressive.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, best to fold or call? Call is cheap (8) and we can see flop. If we call, we will be out of position postflop (but we are BTN, after flop we will be first to act preflop? Actually after flop, BTN is last to act preflop, but after flop, action starts with SB then BB then BTN. So we will be last (position) after flop as well, which is good. So calling is okay.\n\nPot odds: pot 12, call 8 => pot will be 20 after call. So we invest 8 to potentially win 20 (pot odds 2.5:1). Hand equity of 8c7d vs unknown range? Likely low, maybe ~10-12% vs random. Not enough.\n\nThus fold might be best to preserve chips. But we have 14.9 BB, we can afford to fold a marginal hand. However, we could also call and try to hit a straight or two pair. But with such low stack, we need to accumulate chips.\n\nGiven typical tournament strategy: with 15 BB, you want to be selective but also look for steal opportunities. 8c7d off-suit is not a steal candidate; you would usually raise with stronger hands (broadway, suited connectors). So folding is reasonable.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have pocket 6s, small stack 111 chips, blinds 8. After SB 4, BB 8, UTG? Actually seat2 raise 24 (3bb). Seat3 (DeepSeek) re-raises to 60 (7.5bb). So we face a 3-bet to 60, we are in BB, stack 111, pot currently 92 (blinds+SB+BB+raise+re-raise? Let's compute: SB 4, BB 8, seat2 raise to 24 (so put 24, call 24? Actually seat2 raised from 8? Wait seat2 is UTG maybe? He raised to 24, that means he put 24 total, adding 24-8? But BB already posted 8, so seat2's raise is 24 total, meaning 24-8 =16 extra. Then seat3 re-raises to 60, meaning adds 60-24=36. So pot = SB 4 + BB 8 + seat2 24 + seat3 60 = 96? But they say pot 92 chips. Might be rounding. Anyway, amount to call is 52 (to match 60). Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise to 96 total). Our stack 111, so we could call 52 leaving 59 chips, or raise all-in 111. Pocket 6s is a small pair, not great against likely stronger ranges. 3-bet from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat3) maybe aggressive. Our stack short, we could consider calling to set mine, but 6s set odds? Against 3-bet, calling with small pair is okay if implied odds good. However tournament, short stack 13.9 BB, we could either call and hope to hit set (12% chance). If we call, we will be out of position post-flop against a 3-bettor, likely will have to fold unless set. If we go all-in, we are raising to 111 (total). That would be a raise to 111, which is above min raise. That would be a shove. Is that profitable? Our hand is small pair, not strong enough to shove vs 3-bet. Better to call and try set. But we have only 59 chips left after call, still short. If we call and miss set, we likely fold. So expected value: 12% chance win pot (maybe 96+?), but we also risk 52 chips. EV = 0.12* (pot after call? pot would be 60+52 call? Actually we call 52, pot becomes 92+52 =144? Wait initial pot 92 includes seat3's 60. So after we call 52, pot = 92+52 =144. If we hit set, we likely win the pot plus maybe opponent's remaining stack? Opponent seat3 has 184 chips total, after 60 in pot, they have 124 left. Our call leaves us 59 left. If we hit set, we could be all-in for 59 vs their 124? Actually we are not all-in, just called. But they could bet later. So maybe not great.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe better to shove all-in to try to steal blinds? But we have a pair, not a steal. However raising all-in may force fold from seat2 and seat3 if they think we have premium. But seat3 just 3-bet, likely strong. So likely they'd call. Not good.\n\nThus best is call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have 6, board 7-9, missing 8 for gutshot straight (needs 8). Also need 5 for 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 6, board 7,9, need 8 and 5? Not relevant. So we have a low pair, likely losing to overpairs, J, etc. Opponent seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 59 into pot 203 (so about 0.29 pot). Their betting pattern: historically small flop bets (4,8,15) relative to pot. This seems a continuation bet, maybe with a wide range. Our hand is weak. We have 59 to call, min raise 118 but we cannot raise (legal only fold/call). So we can call or fold. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 203 + opponent bet 59 = 262 total after call. Call 59 to win 262 => odds 4.44:1. Need win >22.5% to be profitable. Our hand likely far less. So fold.\n\nBut consider tournament situation: stack 59 chips (7.4 BB). We're short-stacked, but we have 59 chips left (including 8 BB). Actually we have 59 chips total, we already posted 8 BB, we called 52 preflop, leaving 59?

So we are very short, 7.4 BB. On flop, opponent bets 59 (our entire stack). So calling would be all-in. Actually amount to call 59 equals our stack. So calling would be all-in, we risk elimination.

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 2c7c, stack 55, blinds 4/8, pot 20. Opponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted SB 4? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 4, seat2 called 8 (big blind?), seat3 folded. So we are BB, after SB and BB posted, seat2 (UTG?) called 8, now it's our turn. Amount to call is 4 (the SB? Actually we already posted BB 8, SB 4, then seat2 called 8, so we need to call 0? But they say amount to call: 4. Probably because we posted BB 8, SB 4, seat2 called 8, we need to call 0? Wait: In BB, after SB and BB posted, the action starts with UTG (seat2). Seat2 called 8 (so just called big blind). Then it's our turn in BB, we have already posted 8, so amount to call is 0. But they say amount to call: 4. Maybe they treat the small blind as amount to call? Actually if SB is 4, BB is 8, UTG calls 8, then BB can check (no further bet). So amount to call should be 0. But the system says amount to call: 4. Might be a mistake: perhaps seat2 raised to 8? No, they said call 8. So maybe they treat BB as still needing to call the small blind? That's weird.\n\nGiven legal actions: fold, call, raise. So call would be 4 (maybe to match the SB?). Let's assume we need to call 4 to match the small blind? Actually we are already posted 8, but maybe the pot is 20 (SB+BB+call) = 4+8+8 =20, correct. So amount to call 4 maybe is the difference between our BB 8 and the call 8? No difference. Could be that they treat the small blind as the amount to call because we are out of position? Not sure.\n\nAnyway we have a weak hand 2c7c, not suited for flush? both clubs, but low. Should we fold? In BB with 6.9 BB, with such a weak hand, folding is fine. But we could also call the 4 to see flop cheap. But with 2c7c, not great. In tournament early stage? Stack 55 chips vs blinds 8, so 6.9 BB, short stack. Might want to try to double up. But 2c7c is very weak, not a good candidate to steal. Could consider raising? Minimum raise to 16, which is 8 more than call? Actually raise to 16 total (so raise 8 more). That's 2 BB raise. Could be a steal attempt but hand is terrible. So likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: seat2 maybe just called big blind, maybe not aggressive. But we have no reason to play weak hand.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total 40). Opponent seat 2 is Kimi-K2. Their raise history: they have raised 12 (small) and 24 in recent hands. So they may be opening wide? 24 is 3x BB (since BB is 8). That's a standard open size (3BB). In a 5.9 BB stack, we are short-stacked. Q7 offsuit is a weak hand. In BB, we could consider a shove if we think we are short enough. But we have 47 chips, which is about 5.9 BB. Minimum raise to 40, which would be a raise of 32 total (8 already posted). Actually we have posted 8 BB, call amount 16 to match 24 raise, making total 24. Minimum raise to 40 means raise total to 40, i.e., add 32 more (total 40). That would be a raise of 32, which is 4 BB more (since 8 BB is 8). Our stack 47, we could raise to 40, leaving 7 chips behind (i.e., we could go all-in for 47). But raising to 40 is allowed. Should we call 16? That would leave us 31 chips after call. But we would be out of position post-flop, with a weak hand. Likely best to fold. However with short stack maybe we could shove all-in (raise to 47) to try to steal blinds? But opponent just raised, not a blind steal. We are in BB, they raised from UTG? Actually seat 2 is early position (maybe UTG). Raising 24 suggests they have a decent hand. Q7 offsuit doesn't play well. So folding is standard.\n\nBut we could consider a 3-bet all-in to apply pressure, but with Q7 it's weak. Likely fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop in BB with 4h Ac, stack 39, blinds 8/16, pot 24. Effective stack is 39, after posting big blind 16, we have 23 left to act (plus 16 already in pot). We face a call amount of 8 (to match SB? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, so amount to call is 8 to call the SB's raise? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, so BB is already 16 in, SB is 8, so amount to call is 8 to match SB. So we can call 8 to see flop, or raise min to 32 (total). Our hand A4 offsuit, weak Ace. With short stack (2.4 BB) we might consider going all-in? Actually min raise is 32, which would be total 32 chips, meaning we need to put additional 16 (since we already have 16). That would be 32 total, leaving us 7 chips left (since stack 39). That's a decent raise for a short stack, but A4 is weak. Could also just call 8 and hope to see flop, but with such short stack you might want to be aggressive or fold. In BB, with only 2.4 BB left, you are short-stacked. A4 offsuit is not great for a shove. Usually you would shove with any Ace when short-stacked? At 2.4 BB, you could shove all-in (which is 39 total). But min raise to 32 is less than all-in. You could raise to 32 (i.e., put 16 more) leaving 7 left, then likely be forced all-in later. Might be better to shove all-in to maximize fold equity. But you only have 39 chips; if you raise to 32, you still have 7 left, you could be called and then you still have 7 to act later (post-flop). Might be okay.\n\nWhat about opponent tendencies? There's only Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) left to act after us? Actually order: SB (Seat5) posted sb? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking? Actually seat5 is us. The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8? That seems weird: seat5 is BB but posted sb 8? Might be mislabel. Actually seat5 posted sb 8 (so we are SB?), seat1 posted bb 16 (so seat1 is BB). So we are in SB, not BB. The description says Position: BB (Seat5) but actions show seat5 post_sb 8. Possibly they swapped? Anyway we are small blind with 8 posted, big blind is seat1 with 16. So amount to call is 8 (to match big blind). So we are SB with A4 offsuit, stack 39, 2.4 BB. We can call 8, raise to 32 (minimum), or fold.\n\nGiven short stack, typical strategy: If you have Ace, you can shove all-in (or raise) to try to steal blinds. A4 is weak but still Ace high, but against unknown opponent could be okay. However, we have a 2.4 BB stack, raising to 32 leaves 7 chips, which is still short. Might as well go all-in (raise to 39) to maximize pressure. But min raise is 32, but we can raise to any amount up to all-in, as long as it's a legal raise. So we can raise to 39 (all-in). That would be a raise of 31 more (since we already posted 8). That is a raise to total 39. Is that allowed? Yes, raise_to is total amount you put in. So raise_to 39.\n\nWe need to consider opponent: Seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, likely a typical player. With 2.4 BB, you want to either fold or push. A4 is not premium but could be used to push.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving chips is important but also stealing blinds is good. With only 39 chips, you need to build. So I think go all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 39, reasoning.\n\n",

We are to act facing BB 16 (already posted). Amount to call 16 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have a short stack (3.9 BB). Jd8d suited is a marginal hand, but can be used for a steal or shove. With 3.9 BB, typical strategy is to either shove all-in or fold, rarely raise small. Since min raise is 32, that would be a raise to 32 total, which is 2 BB more than call (call 16, raise to 32). That would be 2 BB raise (i.e., 2x BB). That's a 2BB raise, which is a small raise but still above min. However with such a short stack, better to either shove all-in (63 chips) or call and hope to see flop cheap? But calling 16 leaves us with 47 left, still short.\n\nGiven position BTN, we could attempt to steal the blinds by raising all-in. Opponents: Seat1 (SB) Kimi-K2 with 305 chips, Seat2 (BB) also Kimi-K2 with 259 chips? Actually both seats have same name, maybe same player? Two opponents: one SB, one BB. Their tendencies: recall shows they sometimes raise preflop (24 chips raise), sometimes call small (4), sometimes check. They seem to be somewhat tight? Hard to tell. In previous hands they raised to 24 (i.e., 1.5 BB) preflop. That's a moderate raise. They also sometimes call small amounts.\n\nGiven our stack, if we call 16, we will be out of position post-flop with J8 suited. Not great. Better to go all-in to maximize fold equity, especially against SB who might fold. BB might call with a wide range? BB's stack is 259, they could call with many hands.\n\nThus I think best is to raise all-in (i.e., raise to 63). Since raise_to should be total amount we put in. Our stack is 63 chips. So raise_to 63.\n\nWe need to ensure legal: raise is allowed. Minimum raise to 32, we can raise to 63 (all-in). So action: raise, raise_to: 63.\n\nReasoning: short stack, suited connectors marginal, better to go all-in to steal blinds, etc.\n\nThus produce JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Q\u2660 3\u2660 - This is a suited but weak hand. Queen-high with a 3 kicker is not strong, but being suited gives some potential for flush draws. However, the 3 is very low.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is excellent position. I'll act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 349 chips (43.6 BB) - Healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n4. **Pot**: 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8)\n\n5. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Looking at their history, they fold a lot preflop (hands 43,44,45,47), but they did call once in hand 48 and then fold on flop, and raised in hand 49. They seem somewhat tight but can be aggressive.\n   - Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Very tight! They folded in hands 45,46,48,49,50. Only played hand 44 (called preflop and bet flop) and hand 47 (checked and folded).\n\n6. **Action**: I need to call 8 to see flop.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: 12:8 or 1.5:1. Need 40% equity to break even.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 43.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can afford to wait for better hands.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Q3s is a marginal hand at best\n- While I'm on the Button with good position, this hand doesn't play well post-flop\n- The BB (DeepSeek) is very tight, so stealing might work, but the SB (Kimi) is more active\n- With Q3s, I'm likely dominated if I hit a Queen, and flush draws will be weak (3-high flush)\n- The pot odds aren't great for this hand quality\n- I should preserve my stack for better opportunities\n\nDecision: FOLD. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, even with position, and I have a healthy stack that doesn't require taking marginal spots.",

While pot odds are 2:1, the hand has poor equity and position disadvantage. Opponent has shown aggressive tendencies but folding preserves stack for better spots with 34.5 BB remaining.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the BB with 9c Td (off-suit nine-ten)\n- My stack: 276 chips (34.5 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised to 24 total (SB to BB raise)\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Pot: 32 chips (blinds 4+8 + raise 24)\n- Opponent stack: 247 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 9T off-suit is a weak hand. It's a speculative hand that needs help to improve. Not a premium hand by any means.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB vs SB raiser). This is a disadvantage as I'll have to act first on future streets.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 35, 36, 40, 49). In hand #49, they raised to 24 from SB, then bet 40 on flop. They seem somewhat aggressive but not overly wild. They've also folded many hands preflop when facing action.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 32, I need to call 16. That's 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). With 9T off-suit, I likely don't have 33% equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 9T off-suit has around 40% equity heads-up, but I'm out of position which reduces my effective equity.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 34.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Calling 16 chips (2 BB) is 5.8% of my stack. Not huge, but committing with a weak hand out of position is problematic.\n\n6. **Implied odds:** If I hit a good flop (pair, straight draw, two pair), I could potentially win more chips. But 9T off-suit doesn't flop well often, and when it does, it's often second-best hands.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations:** I should be looking for better spots. With 34.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal situations out of position.\n\n**Better alternatives:**\n- Fold: Preserve chips for better spots\n- Raise: Could 3-bet bluff, but with 9T off-suit and out of position, risky\n- Call: Marginal at best\n\nGiven the pot odds are decent (2:1), but the hand is weak and I'm out of position, folding seems correct. The opponent has shown willingness to raise from SB, so they might be stealing, but even against a stealing range, 9T off-suit isn't great.\n\nI should wait for better spots in position or with stronger holdings.",

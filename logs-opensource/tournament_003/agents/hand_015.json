            "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have information about GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **My hand**: K\u2665 4\u2660 - This is a weak hand, offsuit, with a gap. King-high but very weak kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 from late position (seat 5 with 5 players). The pot is 9 chips, I need to call 5 more.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - Hand 14: Raised preflop (amount 8)\n   - Hands 13, 12, 11, 10: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 9: Called preflop, then bet on flop\n   - Hand 8: Checked preflop, folded on flop\n   - Hand 7: Folded on turn\n\n   So they raise occasionally (hand 14 and now hand 15), but fold a lot. Their raise in hand 14 was for 8 chips, now they're raising to 6. This seems like a standard opening raise from late position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 5 to win 9, so about 1.8:1 pot odds, which is roughly 36% equity needed.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: K4o has about 40-45% equity against a random hand, but against a raising range from late position, it's likely much worse - probably around 30-35% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n8. **Position disadvantage**: I'll be out of position post-flop, which makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. The opponent seems to be raising with some frequency but also folding a lot. \n\nThe raise to 6 suggests they have a real hand. Given my weak K4o, out of position, and the fact that I need to hit something specific (like a king with a good kicker, or trips) to continue, this is an easy fold.\n\nLet me fold here.",

This suggests an active table.\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (11 folds out of 14 hands, 2 wins). One win was from the BB when everyone folded. I'm playing tight.\n\nMy stack is 185 chips (92.5 BB) - healthy but not huge.

Pocket pairs 7s are medium strength; in early stage with deep stacks, raising is common for value and to isolate. Opponent in SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking, who has shown both calls and folds, also raised to 6 in some hands (maybe 3BB). Their behavior seems mixed; they sometimes raise, sometimes fold, sometimes call. Since they are SB (tight? unknown). Our stack is deep enough to raise. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., 2 more). Usually we could raise to 6-8 to isolate. However, we must consider tournament stage: 93 BB, still early, can be aggressive. The SB's stack is 221 chips (111.5 BB). They have more chips. Raising may get them to fold if they are tight, but they have raised before. Could also just call to see flop cheap. With pocket sevens, set mining is possible but not huge; calling 2 chips for a 3 chip pot is good odds (2 to call, pot 3+2=5? Actually pot currently 3 chips (SB+BB+our call? Wait pot before our action: SB 1, BB 2, total 3. To call we need 2 more, making pot 5). Pot odds ~40% to hit set (approx 12% chance). So call is okay. Raising could build pot if we hit set, but also risk bigger loss if we get called and lose.\n\nGiven opponent's mixed behavior, a raise to maybe 6 (3BB) could be good. Minimum raise is 4 (i.e., total 4). But raise to 6 would be 3 additional chips (total 6). Is that allowed? Minimum raise to is 4, so raise must be at least 4 total. We can raise to any amount above that (subject to stack). Raising to 6 seems fine.\n\nConsider risk: If they call, pot becomes 3+ (our raise 6-2?) Wait we raise to 6 total, meaning we put 6 chips in, they already have 2 (BB) and 1 (SB). So they'd need to call 4 more (if they call). That would be a 9 chip pot preflop (1+2+6). If they re-raise, we may be in trouble.\n\nGiven we have a decent pair, I'd raise to 6 to try to isolate and get value. Reasoning: we want to build pot with a medium pair, and SB may fold or call; if they call we have good equity.\n\nThus decision: raise to 6.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop: board 7d 5s Tc. We have pocket sevens, so we have trips (set). Opponent (Seat2) checked. Stack sizes: we have 181 chips, opponent 190 chips. Pot 13. We are on button, we raised preflop to 6, opponent called 4 (so pot 13 includes blinds 1+2+6+4? Actually blinds 1+2 =3, our raise 6 adds 6, opponent call 4 adds 4, total 13). Flop: opponent checked. We have a very strong hand, set of sevens, top set? Board: 7,5,10. No higher pair on board, but there is a possible straight draw: 8-9 gives open-ended straight draw? Board: 7-5-10, the straight possibilities: 6-8? Actually need 6-8 for straight: 6-8-9-10? Let's list combos: With board 7,5,10, the possible straight draws: 6-8 gives 6-7-8-9-10? No 9 missing. Actually need 6-8-9? Let's compute: 6-8-9? Not. Let's think: Straight requires 5 consecutive ranks. With board 5-7-10, you could have 6-8-9? Not present. The board has 5,7,10. To have a straight, you need either 6-8-9? Not possible because need 5 cards. For example, if you have 8-9, you have 5-7-8-9-10? That's missing 6. So not a straight. The only possible straight draws are with 8-9? Actually 6-8? Let's enumerate: board ranks: 5,7,10. Potential straight combos:\n\n- 6-8: would give 5-6-7-8-? need 9 or 4? Not there. So no.\n\n- 8-9: gives 5-7-8-9-10 missing 6. No.\n\n- 4-6: 4-5-6-7-? need 8. Not there.\n\nThus board is not connected; no straight draw. However, there is a possible flush draw? Suits: 7d (diamond), 5s (spade), Tc (club). No two of same suit, so no flush draw. So we have a monster hand, likely best. Opponent checked, we can bet for value. Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? The legal actions: raise to at least 4? But we already have 0 to call. The pot is 13. We could bet 4 (which is a raise to 4 total). That seems small but fine. We could raise bigger for value. Opponent stack 190, we have 181. Likely they have a decent hand like top pair (T) or maybe a draw. We want to extract value. Since we are BTN, we can bet around half pot to pot? Minimum raise is 4, which is about 30% pot. Might want to raise more, maybe to 20-30 chips. But need to be within legal raise range: raise must be at least 4 and at most our stack? Usually raise can be any amount above min. So we can raise to say 30. That would be a bet of 30. Reasonable. We want to maximize value but not scare away. Opponent may call with T, 5, 10, maybe 7? Actually they can't have 7 because we have both sevens. So they could have Ten, maybe 10x, maybe 5x, maybe flush draws? No. So they might call with T, maybe 10-? So we can bet larger.\n\nGiven tournament early stage? Stack 90 BB, not huge but fine. So we can bet maybe 20-30. Let's choose raise to 30.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 30.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: 3d 6d (offsuit, low cards)\n- Board: 2c 9c 4h\n- Pot: 10 chips\n- I need to call 4 chips\n- Position: BB\n- Stack: 219 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have absolutely nothing. 3-high with no draw potential.\n- The board shows a possible straight draw (2-3-4) but I don't have 5\n- Two clubs on board, so flush draw possible\n- I have no pair, no draw, just 3-high\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called preflop, now facing a bet from Seat 5. History shows they call preflop sometimes and make small bets on flop/river. They folded many preflop hands. They seem somewhat passive.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Just bet 4 chips. History shows they were very tight (folded first 3 hands), then in hand 7 they raised preflop, bet flop, called a raise, then folded on turn. They seem capable of bluffing or betting with marginal hands, but also folding when faced with resistance.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 10, I need to call 4\n- Getting 2.5:1 odds\n- I need 28.6% equity to call\n\n**Equity analysis:**\nWith 3-high on a 2-4-9 board, I likely have very low equity. Even against a pure bluff, my 3-high might not be good. I'm probably drawing to runner-runner straight or two pair/trips, which is very unlikely.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have no hand, no draw, and while the pot odds aren't terrible, I have almost no chance of winning this hand. My stack is healthy at 109.5 BB, so there's no need to chase with such a weak hand. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nEven if both opponents are bluffing, my 3-high is very unlikely to be the best hand. The bet from Seat 5 suggests some strength, and I have no information about Seat 4's intentions yet.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about this situation. I'm UTG with 3s5d, which is an extremely weak hand - one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, low cards, no connectivity. In UTG position, I have to act first preflop, which is the worst position to play marginal hands.\n\nMy stack is 185 chips (92.5 BB), so I have a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so it's 2 chips to call. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has shown some aggression - raised to 15 on flop in hand 7, bet turn in hand 5. Folded preflop in 4 of 8 hands, called in 2, raised once. Seems somewhat selective but capable of aggression.\n\n2. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, will act after me): Has mostly folded preflop (6 of 8 hands), called twice. Shows postflop aggression with bets on turn and river in hand 3, and flop bet in hand 8.\n\n3. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB): Folded preflop in 3 of 4 hands, raised once to 6 in hand 7. Shows some postflop aggression with bet on flop in hand 7.\n\nI'm UTG with 3-5 offsuit. This is an easy fold from this position. The hand has almost no potential to make strong hands. Even if I flop a pair, it's bottom pair with weak kicker. The only decent flop would be something like 3-4-5 for a straight draw, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlso, I'm first to act, so if I call, I'll have to act first on every street, which is terrible with a weak hand. There are still 4 players behind me who could raise, putting me in a difficult spot.\n\nPot odds: 2 to call into 3 pot, so I need ~40% equity. 3-5 offsuit has maybe 30% equity against random hands, but worse against the ranges that will continue.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with trash hands from early position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nThis is a clear fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 6s Kc (King of clubs, 6 of spades)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Seat 4\n**Stack**: 212 chips (106.0 BB)\n**Board**: 2c 9c 4h\n**Pot**: 10 chips\n**Amount to call**: 4 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 8 chips\n\n**Current situation analysis:**\n1. I'm in the button position with Kc 6s\n2. The board shows 2c 9c 4h - there's a flush draw with clubs\n3. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) bet 4 chips on the flop\n4. Seat 1 folded to the bet\n5. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise\n\n**Looking at opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data for Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):\n- Recent actions show they folded preflop multiple times (hands 4, 5, 6)\n- In hand 7, they raised preflop 6 chips, then bet 4 on flop, called 11 on turn, but folded on turn\n- In hand 8, they checked preflop and folded on flop\n\nThis suggests they can be aggressive when they have hands, but also fold when they miss.\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\n- My Kc 6s is a weak hand overall\n- I have a King but it's not very strong with 6 kicker\n- The board has potential flush draws (clubs) and straight draws\n- I have no pair, no straight potential with these cards\n- Kc gives me a backdoor flush draw, but it's weak\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- I'm in button position, which is good\n- Only one opponent left (Seat 5) after Seat 1 folded\n- This gives me good information about their bet\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 10 chips, I need to call 4 chips\n\n\n- The pot odds are 2.5:1, which means I need about 29% equity to make a profitable call\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm at 106 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- Losing 4 chips won't significantly impact my tournament position\n- However, I should be careful not to spew chips unnecessarily\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- My hand is weak with no strong draws\n- Opponent shows some aggression but also folds frequently\n- Pot odds suggest I need a reasonable chance to improve my hand\n- The weak nature of my Kc 6s makes continuing difficult\n\n**Final assessment:**\nThe hand's weakness, combined with the marginal pot odds, points toward folding. My King-6 offsuit lacks significant potential, and the board doesn't offer compelling improvement opportunities. With limited equity and an uncertain opponent, the prudent choice is to fold and wait for a stronger hand.\n",

Actually amount to call is 1 (to bring us to 2 total). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4). Need to decide.\n\nAc4d is a weak hand, unsuited, low kicker, not a good raising hand from SB. Should we just call? In SB, we are out of position post-flop, but we have a decent Ace. However, many players will raise with stronger Aces. Calling with Ace low can be okay if we think opponent will check behind? But we are in SB, after BB and MP called, it's likely the BB will check or maybe raise later. The action order: SB acts first preflop after blinds posted. So we can either call 1 (making us 2 total) or raise to 4 (i.e., total 4). Raising with A4 is not advisable. Folding loses 1 blind but we have a decent Ace; but calling is cheap and we can see flop.\n\nGiven tournament stage, stack 90 BB, still deep.

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB with A\u26634\u2666. Board: 2c 9c 4h. So we have top pair (pair of 4s) with Ace kicker, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs) but only one club on board, we have Ace of clubs, so we have nut flush draw? Actually board has 2c and 9c, we have Ac, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs to make flush. Not immediate. Also we have a gutshot? Straight? 4-5-6-7-8? Not.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 called preflop (call 2) from BB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they are in BB? Wait seat 1 is Kimi-K2 (BB). Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they called 2 (big blind) preflop, meaning they are in UTG? Actually positions: SB seat5, BB seat1, seat2 is UTG? Not sure. But we have only two players: SB and BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat4 called preflop, so seat4 is in UTG (maybe MP). So we have a multi-way? But only seat4 and seat5 are active. So it's heads-up post-flop.\n\nStack sizes: MiniMax-M2 has 212 chips. Pot 6. We are SB with 179.\n\nWe have top pair, but board is paired? No pair on board: 2c 9c 4h. We have 4h on board, we have 4d, so we have pair of 4s.\n\nOpponent's tendencies: from recall: they have called preflop with 5 chips (hand 3), then checked flop, bet turn 4, bet river 4. They also in hand 8 called preflop 1, bet flop 2. So they seem to be willing to bet on flop with maybe draws or weak hands. Not too aggressive.\n\nNow current situation: It's our turn after BB checked? Actually actions: preflop: seat5 post sb 1, seat1 post bb 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 call 1, seat1 check. So after preflop, seat1 (BB) checked. Now flop: we are SB, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) is still to act? Actually order: after flop, action starts with first active player left of button? In heads-up SB is first to act preflop, but postflop the order is SB first? Actually in heads-up, the dealer (SB) is first to act preflop, but after flop the SB is first to act. So seat5 acts first. But the log says \"Amount to call: 0\". So it's our turn, we can check or raise. Opponent hasn't acted yet.\n\nWe have top pair, decent hand. Pot is 6. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2 total? Actually raise to 2 chips total, meaning bet 2). That's a small raise (size about 1/3 pot). Could also check and see what opponent does.\n\nGiven opponent may bet on flop with weak draws, we could check and induce a bet, then call or raise. But we also have decent hand, we could lead out to protect against draws. The board has two clubs; opponent could have club draws. Raising may fold out draws? A small raise might be called by draws.\n\nStack depth: we have 179, opponent 212, pot 6. We can bet ~2-3. Could also check.\n\nGiven we have top pair but vulnerable to overpairs (like 99, 22) and flush draws. But opponent's range includes many hands: could have 2c9c, 9c9x, 2c2x, etc. Our Ace kicker is good. So raising is okay.\n\nI think raise to 4 (total 4) maybe? Minimum raise is to 2, but we can raise bigger. However we need to consider tournament stack preservation. But we have big stack relative to blinds.\n\nThus I will raise to 4 chips (total). Reason: protect, get value.\n\nLegal actions: raise is allowed.\n\nThus output.",

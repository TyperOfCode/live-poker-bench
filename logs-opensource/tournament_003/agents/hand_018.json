K5o from UTG is one of the worst hands you could have in the worst position. The king is dominated by any hand with a better kicker (K6+, AK, KQ, KJ, KT), and the 5 gives you almost no additional value.\n\nThe correct play is to fold and wait for a better hand in a better position.",

The blinds are 1/2, I have 199 chips (99.5 BB). Both players to act after me (SB and BB) have shown some tendencies:\n\nSeat 4 (SB - MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 of 10 actions are folds), only called twice when in the blinds. Seems tight.\n\nSeat 5 (BB - GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop in 2 of 10 hands, but those were from different positions. Shows some aggression when they do play.\n\nMy position is excellent - I'm on the button with only the blinds left to act. A9 suited is a playable hand here. I have several options:\n\n1. Fold: Too conservative with a decent suited ace in position\n2. Call: Take a flop cheaply with position\n3. Raise: Take initiative and potentially win the blinds\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: SB folds a lot, BB has shown some aggression but might fold to a raise. A raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x BB) seems reasonable. This would put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 99.5 BB, so I can afford some speculative plays. A9 suited has good potential for flushes and straight draws, plus ace-high value.\n\nI think raising is the best play here. Let's raise to 6 chips total (making it 4 more to call).

The flop is 6\u2665 4\u2663 2\u2665. BB checked to me.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have a strong flush draw (nut flush draw with A\u2665)\n- Overcard with A\u2665\n- Backdoor straight possibilities\n- Decent equity against many hands\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\n- From the history, they've been fairly active preflop (raising in hands 14 and 15)\n- In hand 9, they bet small (4) on the flop\n- In hand 15, they bet large (30) on the flop\n- They've folded preflop frequently (hands 10-13, 16-17)\n- They called my preflop raise this hand\n\n**Board analysis:**\n- 6\u2665 4\u2663 2\u2665 is a very dry board except for my flush draw\n- No obvious straight draws\n- Low cards unlikely to have hit opponent's calling range\n\n**Position:** I have position advantage on the button.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 193 chips (96.5 BB), opponent has 188 chips. Both deep stacks.\n\n**Pot:** 13 chips. I can check back or bet.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card with my flush draw. Low risk but gives opponent free card too.\n2. **Bet:** Build the pot with my equity advantage. If I bet and get called, I can potentially win a bigger pot if I hit my flush.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** They've shown aggression on flops before (betting in hands 9 and 15). Their check here could be:\n- Weakness (missed the board)\n- Trap with a strong hand (set, two pair)\n- Slow play with a monster\n\nGiven the dry board and my flush draw, I think betting is good here. I can represent a strong hand (overpair, top pair) and potentially take it down now. If called, I have good equity to continue.\n\nA bet of 6-8 chips (about half pot) seems reasonable. This builds the pot while not committing too much if I face resistance.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise is 4, so I can bet any amount from 4 up.\n\nI'll bet 7 chips (a little over half pot). This puts pressure on opponent while leaving room to maneuver on later streets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 7,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Betting for value with nut flush draw on dry board.

Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, unknown position (Seat 3 is after SB and BB, so seat 3 is UTG? Seats: seat 1 (UTG?), seat 2 (UTG+1), seat 3 (UTG+2?), but anyway it's early position. Their raise size is 6 (3bb). Our hand is a decent speculative hand, but out of position. With 96 BB stack, we can consider 3-bet? Usually QJ suited is a marginal 3-bet candidate. Could call to see flop and try to outplay. In tournament early stage (96 BB), we can be a bit looser. The opponent's raise size is standard. We need to consider opponent's tendencies: they raised 6 previously twice (hand #3 and #17) and also raised 18 in hand #2 (maybe larger stack). No info on fold/call. Could be a standard raise.\n\nGiven we have 96 BB, calling 4 adds 4 to pot, pot becomes 13 (9+4). Implied odds? QJ suited can flop a lot of strong draws. Out of position, but can see cheap flop. Probably call is fine. Raising to 10 (minimum raise) would be a 5bb raise total, 4bb more. That would be a 3-bet of 5bb (2.5bb more than original raise). That's a bit small for 3-bet, but could be okay as a semi-bluff. However, our hand is not premium enough to 3-bet for value, and we risk being 4-beted. So better to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n",

Our hand: Qc Js, no pair, no draw. Board has two hearts, we have no heart. So no flush draw. Straight draw? We have J and Q, board 6-4-2, we need 8-7-5-3 to make straight. Not relevant. So we have just high cards. Opponent likely has something. They raised preflop, could have many combos: broadways, suited connectors, etc. On flop, they may continuation bet. But we have no action yet: amount to call is 0? Wait legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0, meaning opponent hasn't bet yet? Actually we are first to act on flop? The actions list only shows preflop. On flop, maybe it's our turn to act first (since they raised preflop, they are first to act postflop). But amount to call 0 indicates they haven't bet yet. So we can check or raise. Should we check? With weak hand, likely check and hope they also check. If they bet, we can consider folding. Raising may be a bluff but we have 94 BB, deep stack. Opponent stack 193 chips, about 96 BB. Raising could be a steal? But we are out of position (BB vs opponent in earlier position). Actually we are in BB, they are seat3 (maybe UTG). On flop, action goes to seat3 first (since they were the raiser preflop). But we see amount to call 0, maybe they checked. So we have option to check or raise. With Qc Js, no equity, maybe check. Could also raise as a semi-bluff? Not much draws. So check is best.\n\nThus output: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

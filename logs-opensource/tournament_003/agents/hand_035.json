Despite good pot odds (5:1), I'm out of position against both the BB and a caller. My hand has poor equity and reverse implied odds. Better to preserve my 27.5 BB stack for better opportunities.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: Td 5c is a very weak hand in the SB. It's unsuited and disconnected, with only a backdoor straight possibility.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be out of position against the BB and the caller (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 110 chips (27.5 BB), which is a decent stack. I shouldn't be taking unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent Behavior**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - They called preflop in hand #34 (from BB position, likely checking)\n   - They checked through flop, turn, river in hand #34 and then folded\n   - They called 8 chips in hand #31 and then folded\n   - Generally passive, calling and checking rather than raising\n\n5. **Current Action**: The action is to me in SB. There's already 10 chips in the pot. I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I'm getting 5:1 pot odds (10:2), which is attractive, but with T5o I have very little equity even against random hands.\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I should be selective. My VPIP (voluntarily put money in pot) has been low based on my hand history - I've folded a lot. This suggests I should continue to be tight, especially from SB with a weak hand.\n\n8. **My Recent Results**: I won hand #34 with a river bet, but overall my win rate is only 17.6%. I should stick to stronger hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. T5o is a trash hand, I'm out of position, and even though the pot odds are good, the reverse implied odds are terrible. I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand that will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\nThe fact that GPT-OSS-120B called suggests they might have something, and I'll be out of position against both players. Better to wait for a better spot.",

Their bet on the flop suggests some strength.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 18 chips and I need to call 8 chips, giving me about 2.25:1 pot odds. This isn't great for a weak draw.\n\n4. **Stack considerations**: I have 52 BB which is healthy, but I should avoid bleeding chips with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Position**: In BB, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nThe paired board reduces the value of my flush draw, and the opponent's flop bet after checking preflop suggests they have something. With Q-high and only a backdoor flush draw, this is a clear fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand with limited potential on a paired board.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in UTG position with Q3s (queen-three suited). This is a very weak hand, especially from early position. Looking at my past hands, I've consistently folded weak hands from UTG. The hand history shows I've folded 72s, Q2s, 3Js, A7o, A3o, and even pocket 33 from UTG.\n\nMy stack is 192 chips (48 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 2/4.\n\nThe opponents: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, 110 chips), Kimi-K2 (seat 2, 209 chips), MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 297 chips), GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, 186 chips). I need to consider that I'm first to act preflop, with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\nQ3s is a speculative hand that needs a very favorable flop to continue. From UTG, this is a clear fold in most poker strategies. The suitedness gives some potential for flush draws, but the gap between Q and 3 is large, making straight potential limited.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has shown some aggression with raises preflop. MiniMax-M2 also raises preflop. With weak players behind who might raise, I don't want to call 4 chips and then face a raise, forcing me to fold and lose my investment.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 into a pot of 6, giving me 1.5:1 odds, but the hand is too weak to justify even a small investment from early position.\n\nTournament considerations: With 48 BB, I have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. No need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker strategy - Q3s from UTG is unplayable.",

A modest raise to 8 builds the pot for our strong hand, extracts value from worse tens or sevens, and protects against draws while still being affordable for both stacks.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 7c 7h Th. Our hand: 2h Ts. So we have top pair (tens) with a weak kicker (2). Also we have a backdoor straight draw? Actually with 2 and T, we have pair of tens, plus potential flush draw? We have hearts: 2h and board hearts: none (7c,7h,Th). Only hearts: Th is heart, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have 2h and Th, both hearts, so we have two hearts, board has no hearts. So we have a flush draw (need two more hearts on turn and river). Also we have a pair of tens, but board has pair of sevens. Opponent is Kimi-K2, seat 2, in BB, with 209 chips. He checked flop. We can check or raise. Consider stack sizes: we have 182 chips, opponent 209. Pot 10. Minimum raise is 4 (so raise to 4? Actually raise_to total is 4? Minimum raise to 4 means raise total to 4? Wait, we have already 4 in pot from blinds? Preflop we called 4, opponent posted 4. So pot 10 includes 4+4+2? Actually blinds: SB 2, BB 4, we called 4, so pot 10 (2+4+4). On flop, opponent checked, amount to call 0, min raise to 4 (so raise total to 4). So raising to 4 would be a small raise (bet 4). That is 0.4 BB relative to current BB 4? Actually raise to 4 means total bet 4, which is same as BB amount. So a 4 chip bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but not strong. Opponent's checking could be weak or could be drawing. We have a strong draw (flush) and a pair. Might want to bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands like 7x, lower pair, etc. But also we could check to see a free card and possibly improve.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We saw they checked flop 4 times in past. No raises. Likely passive, maybe checks with everything. So we can take initiative.\n\nStack depth: Both have similar stacks, 45 BB vs 52 BB. Not a huge stack. Raising small could set up pot. If we bet 4 (pot sized 10, bet 4 is 0.4 pot). Might get called by worse hands, maybe raise by stronger like a set (7s) or two pair (T7). But we have top pair, we want value. Could also be a trap.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw, we could also bet as semi-bluff. But small bet may not protect.\n\nThus I think raising to 8 (i.e., a bet of 8) could be better, but min raise is 4, but we can raise to any amount up to stack. However we need to ensure raise amount is total, not addition. So raise_to maybe 12? Actually we could raise to 12 (bet 12). But is that allowed? Yes, we can raise to any amount above minimum raise (which is 4). But we need to consider stack: we have 182 chips, opponent 209, so max we can bet is 182 (all-in). But we likely want a modest bet.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we might want to extract value. Opponent may have a weaker ten, or a 7, or a straight draw. A bet of around half pot (5) could be good. Minimum raise is 4, but we could raise to 6 or 8. Let's decide raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That is 0.8 pot, decent.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds for opponent: pot 10, bet 8, pot becomes 18, opponent must call 8, pot odds 8/18 ~44%. Might fold weaker draws.\n\nGiven opponent is passive, maybe they will call with any pair, but may fold draws.\n\nI think raising to 8 is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8, reasoning: we have top pair with a flush draw, want value and protect, opponent passive, small raise to build pot.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

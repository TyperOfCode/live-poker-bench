It has almost no straight potential (only 4-5 makes a straight), no flush potential, and very low pair potential. This is a clear fold in virtually all situations.\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position to play a weak hand from. If I call or raise, I'll be out of position against everyone else at the table for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nAt 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not critically short yet. However, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. With a hand this weak, I should definitely fold.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: Mixes calls and folds, occasionally raises. Seems somewhat loose but not overly aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: Very tight preflop, folds most hands. Only called once in the sample.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mix of raises and folds, but mostly folds recently. Seems to be playing tight.\n\nEven if the opponents are playing tight, 2-3 offsuit is still a clear fold UTG.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 12.6 BB, I need to be selective. I should wait for a much better hand or situation. Playing 2-3 offsuit UTG would be a waste of chips.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. The hand has very little equity, I'm out of position, and I have a short stack that needs to be preserved.",

My stack is 217 chips (13.6 BB), which is short but not desperate. The blinds are 8/16.\n\nThe action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 16, and Seat 1 folded. So it's folded to me on the button. I have to act with just the SB and BB left to act.\n\nFrom my opponent analysis:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) seems to be a calling station - they've called preflop 13 times in the data I saw, often calling significant amounts. They have 429 chips (26.8 BB), so they're the big stack.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is more aggressive - they've raised preflop 13 times, including some big raises. They have 116 chips (7.25 BB), which is very short.\n\nMy options: fold, call 16, or raise to at least 32.\n\nWith Kh 2c, this is a very weak hand. King-rag offsuit has poor playability postflop. However, I'm on the button, which is the best position. The BB is very short (7.25 BB), which means they might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\nPot odds: calling 16 to win 24 gives me 1.5:1 odds, which isn't terrible, but the hand is weak.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 13.6 BB, which is short but not desperate. The BB has only 7.25 BB and might shove over any raise. The SB has a big stack and could call or raise.\n\nIf I raise, I could potentially steal the blinds, but with the BB so short, they might shove over me. If I call, I'm playing a weak hand out of position against two opponents (SB will likely call with his calling tendencies).\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I raised on the button with Kc Th and won the pot preflop (hand 62). That's a much better hand than Kh 2c.\n\nI should probably fold this weak hand. While button position is good, Kh 2c is just too weak to play, especially with a short-stacked BB who might shove. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any patterns of BB shoving over button raises."

My stack is 217 chips (13.6 BB), which is short but not desperate. The blinds are 8/16.\n\nThe action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 16, and Seat 1 folded. So it's folded to me on the button. I have to act with just the SB and BB left to act.\n\nFrom my opponent analysis:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) seems to be a calling station - they've called preflop 13 times in the data I saw, often calling significant amounts. They have 429 chips (26.8 BB), so they're the big stack.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is more aggressive - they've raised preflop 13 times, including some big raises. They have 116 chips (7.25 BB), which is very short.\n\nMy options: fold, call 16, or raise to at least 32.\n\nWith Kh 2c, this is a very weak hand. King-rag offsuit has poor playability postflop. However, I'm on the button, which is the best position. The BB is very short (7.25 BB), which means they might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\nPot odds: calling 16 to win 24 gives me 1.5:1 odds, which isn't terrible, but the hand is weak.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 13.6 BB, which is short but not desperate. The BB has only 7.25 BB and might shove over any raise. The SB has a big stack and could call or raise.\n\nIf I raise, I could potentially steal the blinds, but with the BB so short, they might shove over me. If I call, I'm playing a weak hand out of position against two opponents (SB will likely call with his calling tendencies).\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I raised on the button with Kc Th and won the pot preflop (hand 62). That's a much better hand than Kh 2c.\n\nI should probably fold this weak hand. While button position is good, Kh 2c is just too weak to play, especially with a short-stacked BB who might shove. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any patterns of BB shoving over button raises.",

Hand strength: Q5o is weak, but...\n2. Pot odds: Getting 4:1 to call 8 chips into 24-chip pot\n3. Position: Button gives me post-flop advantage\n4. Opponent tendency: Seems tight/passive, likely to c-bet and give up\n5. Stack size: At 26.8 BB, I can't afford to be too conservative\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds and position advantage against a seemingly passive opponent, calling makes sense. If I hit a Queen or get good board texture, I can potentially win a decent pot. The 4:1 odds make this a mathematically sound call even with a weak hand.\n\nI should call the 8 chips.\n",

The opponent is likely either:\n1. Making a very strong value bet (set, two pair, flush)\n2. Attempting a large bluff with their last chips\n\nMy pair of 5s isn't strong enough to call such a large bet, and I have enough chips to continue in the tournament.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand carefully:\n\nMy hand: 5c Qd\nBoard: 8d 5s 2s Jd\nPosition: BTN\nStack: 421 chips (26.3 BB)\nPot: 148 chips\nOpponent (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 116 on the turn\n\nLooking at my hand analysis:\n- I have a pair of 5s (one on board, one in hand)\n- I have Qd which gives me a potential flush draw (diamond)\n- The opponent made a large bet of 116 into a 148 chip pot - this is about 78% of the pot\n\nLet me check what I know about the opponent:\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions, I see that GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive on the turn - mostly checking, with one bet of 8 chips. This large bet of 116 seems very unusual for this player based on the limited data.\n\nMy hand strength:\n- I have middle pair (pair of 5s) \n- I have a flush draw with Qd\n- I also have a gutshot straight draw if a 4 or 6 comes\n- My hand is decent but not premium\n\nThe bet sizing is very large - 116 into 148 is about 78% pot. This suggests either:\n1. A very strong hand (like a set, two pair, or made flush)\n2. A bluff with a big draw\n3. An attempt to push me off weaker hands\n\nLooking at my tournament position:\n- I have 421 chips (26.3 BB) - decent stack\n- The opponent has 0 chips and is out, so this is their last hand\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read... \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". But they're betting 116? That seems impossible. \n\nActually, looking at the action history:\n- preflop: Seat 5 post_bb 16\n\n\n- They initially had 16 chips, but somehow bet 116 on the turn\n- This appears to be a technical error or misunderstanding in the game state\n\nI'll carefully evaluate my options. With limited chips and an unclear betting situation, I need to make a cautious decision. The large bet suggests strength, and my middle pair with a flush draw doesn't justify calling or raising. Folding seems the most prudent choice given the ambiguous circumstances.\n\nThe key factors are the unusual bet sizing, the opponent's apparent chip count discrepancy, and my marginal hand strength. A conservative approach protects my tournament position and avoids unnecessary risk.",

Suits: we have 7s, board has 5s and 2s, that's two spades on board, we have one spade, need two more spades for flush (no). So not a flush draw. We have pair? No. So hand is weak, only gutshot draw, about 4 outs (four sixes). Pot 32, we have 0 to call, we can check. Opponent MiniMax-M2 checked on flop. So we could check behind. Raising might be a bluff but we have short stack (7.2 BB). Raising to 16 would be a half pot raise. Could we try to steal? Opponent may have a wide range. But our hand is weak; with short stack, maybe we should check and hope turn improves or we can fold later.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 116 chips, 7 BB, short. Need to pick spots to double up. Opponent's flop tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 has bet on flop in various amounts, but also checks sometimes (this hand). So unknown.\n\nGiven we have 0 to call, checking is safe. Could also consider raising to put pressure, but risk losing chips if opponent re-raises or calls with better hand. Since we have only 7 BB, we might want to be aggressive to try to win pot. However, our hand is not strong, and a raise might get called by better hands (e.g., 8x, 5x, etc). Opponent may have a pair of 8s or 5s. Raising could be costly.\n\nThus best: check."

So we have open-ended? Let's see: possible straight combos: 4-5-6-7-8 would need 6. We have 4 and 7, board 5 and 8. So we need a 6 for straight (gutshot). Also we have a flush draw? Suits: we have 7s, board has 5s and 2s, that's two spades on board, we have one spade, need two more spades for flush (no). So not a flush draw. We have pair? No. So hand is weak, only gutshot draw, about 4 outs (four sixes). Pot 32, we have 0 to call, we can check. Opponent MiniMax-M2 checked on flop. So we could check behind. Raising might be a bluff but we have short stack (7.2 BB). Raising to 16 would be a half pot raise. Could we try to steal? Opponent may have a wide range. But our hand is weak; with short stack, maybe we should check and hope turn improves or we can fold later.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 116 chips, 7 BB, short. Need to pick spots to double up. Opponent's flop tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 has bet on flop in various amounts, but also checks sometimes (this hand). So unknown.\n\nGiven we have 0 to call, checking is safe. Could also consider raising to put pressure, but risk losing chips if opponent re-raises or calls with better hand. Since we have only 7 BB, we might want to be aggressive to try to win pot. However, our hand is not strong, and a raise might get called by better hands (e.g., 8x, 5x, etc). Opponent may have a pair of 8s or 5s. Raising could be costly.\n\nThus best: check.",

The opponent has been checking on every street, indicating a weak or marginal hand. As a short stack (7.2 BB) I need to accumulate chips, so I will shove all",
            "reasoning_content": "We have a turn with board 8d 5s 2s Jd. Our hand 4d7s, so we have no pair, no draw (gutshot? 6 would give straight 2-5-6-7-8 but we have 4 and 7, not). We have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two diamonds (8d,Jd) and we have 4d, so we have a flush draw with one diamond, need two more diamonds on river, low chance. Also we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7 would need 3 and 6, not. So basically very weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking on turn repeatedly (preflop called small blind, flop checked, turn checked). So they likely have a weak hand or a draw. They could be checking with a made hand like J8? Actually board: 8d 5s 2s Jd. They could have J8 (two pair) but they'd likely bet. Checking suggests maybe they have a middle pair (8,5,2) or a draw, or just a weak hand.\n\nWe have 116 chips, 7.2 BB, short stack. Pot is 32, we have 0 to call, can check or raise. Raising could be a bluff to steal, but we are short stack, and opponent may call or raise. Minimum raise is 16, which is about 0.5 BB? Actually blind is 8/16, so raise to 16 is just a raise of 0 (??). Wait minimum raise to 16 means we need to put total 16 chips into pot, which is equal to the big blind amount. Since we have already posted BB 16, and pot currently 32 includes our BB, opponent's small blind 8 and call 8 preflop. So raising to 16 means we add 0 extra? Actually we already have 16 in pot, but raising to 16 would be just matching? This is ambiguous. Usually raise to total amount includes your existing contribution, but we have contributed 16 already, so raise to 16 means no additional chips, which is not a raise. But they list minimum raise to 16, so maybe it's raise to 32? Let's assume raise to 16 means we need to put 16 total, which is same as current bet of 0, but raise must be at least double the previous bet? Since there is no bet, minimum raise is the big blind amount (16). So raising to 32 would be adding 16 chips. So raise_to should be 32? Actually legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check for free. If we raise, we need to put at least 16 chips (the big blind) as a raise, making total contribution 32 (16 more). So raise_to = 32.\n\nWe have 116 chips, can raise 32. Is a bluff worthwhile? Opponent likely has some hand; but we are short stack, need chips. If we check, we may see river for free but still weak. River card unknown. Could be a diamond giving us flush? We have 4d, board has 8d,Jd, need two more diamonds, impossible on river. So no flush. So checking likely leads to showdown losing.\n\nMaybe we should raise as a shove? But raise to 32 is not all-in; we still have 84 chips left. Could we go all-in? Not allowed unless raise is legal? We could raise more than min. Since we have 116, we could raise to 116 (all-in). Is that allowed? Yes, raise_to can be any amount up to stack. That would be a big bluff. But opponent may call if they have any decent hand (like J8, J5, J2, 8J, etc). But they have been checking, maybe they are weak. A shove could force fold many hands, giving us chips.\n\nGiven we are short stack and need to accumulate, a shove may be best. However, risk of being called by a decent hand could cost us all chips. But we have 7 BB, we need to double up. So a shove is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 116 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, weak hand, opponent checking, try to steal pot.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So final JSON.\n\n",

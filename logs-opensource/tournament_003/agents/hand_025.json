            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qh Jc - This is a decent but not premium hand. Suited would be better, but offsuit QJ is still playable in some situations.\n\n**Position:** SB - This is the worst position postflop, as I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n**Stack:** 212 chips (53 BB) - Healthy stack size.\n\n**The situation:** \n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from GPT-OSS-120B's raise)\n- I need to call 10 chips to see the flop\n- I can raise to at least 20 chips total\n\n**Opponent info from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has raised to 12 chips in this hand. Looking at their history:\n- Hand 23: raise 12 (preflop)\n- Hand 21: raise 28 (preflop) then folded later\n- Hand 19: call 1, then check-folded on flop\n- Hand 18: folded on flop\n- Other hands: folded preflop\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is somewhat aggressive preflop but can fold to pressure. The raise sizing of 12 (3x BB) is a standard opening size.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** QJo is marginal, especially from SB. It's dominated by many better hands (AQ, KQ, AJ, etc.)\n2. **Position:** Being in SB is a huge disadvantage - I'll be out of position for the entire hand\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 10 to win 18, so 1.8:1 pot odds. This isn't great for a marginal hand.\n4. **Implied odds:** Limited since I'm out of position\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Calling here commits me to a tough spot postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. QJo from SB facing a raise is a losing proposition long-term. I don't have the position, the hand isn't strong enough, and I'd be playing a guessing game postflop out of position. Better to preserve my chips for a better spot.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this hand. I'm UTG with A3 offsuit. This is a relatively weak hand, especially from UTG position. A3o is not a strong starting hand - it has an ace but with a weak kicker. From UTG, I should be playing tight. \n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop once in hand 16, but mostly folds. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called a couple times but mostly folds. There are 3 players left to act after me (seats 4, 5, and then blinds). \n\nMy stack is 200 chips (50 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 to see the flop, which is 2% of my stack.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I should be playing tight from early position. A3o is a marginal hand that can get me into trouble, especially if an ace flops and I'm dominated by better aces. \n\nThe pot is currently 6 chips (SB + BB). If I just call, I'm inviting others to enter with better hands. Raising would be aggressive but with A3o, I'm likely to be called by better hands or re-raised.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and hand strength (weak ace), folding seems prudent. I have plenty of chips and can wait for better spots. I've been playing fairly tight recently (folded many hands), which is appropriate for tournament play.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any reason to play this. The pot odds are 6:4 or 1.5:1, but implied odds aren't great with a weak ace. I could hit an ace and still lose to better kickers. The 3 is unlikely to help much.\n\nGiven all factors, folding is the correct play. I'll preserve my stack and wait for a better opportunity.",

Calling the 4\u2011chip bet would leave us out of position post\u2011flop with a marginal hand, while a raise also protects our stack and gives us a chance to win the pot outright.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Jd on button, stacks 160 vs 212 and 179. Blinds 2/4, pot 6. SB 2, BB 4. It's our turn after SB and BB posted. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise by at least 4 more). We need decide.\n\nWe have QJ offsuit. Position button. Stack 40 BB, decent stack. Opponents: seat1 (SB) Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 (BB) Kimi-K2. Both have similar stacks ~200. From recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop 6 (i.e., to 6 total? Actually raise amount 6 maybe meaning raise to 6? In previous hands they raised to 6 from 4? That would be a min raise of 2? Not sure. But pattern: they raise preflop 6 often, which is a 2 BB raise (from 4 to 6). So they are likely to raise smallish.\n\nWe are on button with Qc Jd. QJ suited would be stronger; offsuit is moderate. In a 9-player? Actually 5 seats? Only 2 opponents left (SB and BB). So it's heads-up? Actually there are 5 seats total, but 2 folded, leaving 3 players: SB, BB, BTN. So it's 3-way.\n\nGiven we are button, we can open raise. QJ offsuit is a decent hand for button in 3-handed, but also could call a raise. However we face a bet of 4 (big blind). The pot is 6, effective stack 160. If we raise to 8 (minimum), that's 8 total, raising 4 more. That would be a 2 BB raise. That seems small; maybe better to raise more to isolate. With 40 BB stack, we could raise to say 20 chips (5 BB). But legal actions only include raise, not specify max. We can raise to any amount up to stack.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: SB tends to raise preflop to 6 (i.e., 2 BB) sometimes. BB also maybe call. If we raise to 8, they may call. We could also just call 4 and see flop. But calling with QJ off is okay in 3-way? Might get in trouble with overcards. But we have position.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but stack 40 BB is decent, we can be aggressive. QJ offsuit has decent equity vs random, but not great vs strong. I think raise to 12 (3 BB) to isolate and build pot. But need to consider minimum raise is 8; we can raise to 12.\n\nWe should check opponent stacks: both have >200, so they can call. If they both call, pot will be 4 (our call) + 4 (SB) + 4 (BB) = 12 before raise. Actually currently SB posted 2, BB posted 4, pot 6. If we call 4, pot 10. If we raise to 12, we add 8 more (total 12). Then they'd need to call 8 more. Might be okay.\n\nGiven QJ off, I'd raise to 12 to try to take pot, but also consider that QJ offsuit is not premium, but in 3-handed it's okay. I think raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 12. Provide reasoning.\n\n",
